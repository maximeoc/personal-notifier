"""PeerBerry automated investment bot (v1).

CURRENT BEHAVIOR: originators, rates, amounts and caps now come from the
"config robots" sheet (shared.robot_config); the "R\u00e9partition g\u00e9ographique"
sheet is only read once for the already-invested amounts. The remainder of
this docstring is historical (old sheet readers no longer exist).

`workflow_dispatch`-only bot, externally triggered via cron-job.org, that
repeatedly polls PeerBerry's filtered loan listing (same filters as
https://peerberry.com/en/client/invest?sort=-loanId&groupGuarantee=1&loanOriginators=4,12,23,30,33,36,39,41,43,45,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78&minInterestRate=8.5&maxRemainingTerm=185&minRemainingTerm=1,
confirmed with the user 2026-07-30 - critically this DROPS `hideInvested`
entirely (the previous 2026-07-29 filter set included `hideInvested=true`,
which the user confirmed was NOT actually part of their real site filter
after a run saw 0 matching loans across 22272 polls/~75 minutes with this
param present) - see `build_loans_params()`'s own docstring for the
2026-07-29 filter's own history)
and tries to invest available funds into any newly-appeared/still-available
matching loan, as fast as possible (~0.2s polling by default), before other investors
grab it. Within each poll, loans are attempted starting from the END of the
listing (i.e. reversed vs. PeerBerry's own "-loanId" sort/UI order), since
human investors using the real website naturally start clicking from the
top of their screen - loans further down are less likely to already be
contested. On a failed attempt, the bot does NOT wait for the next poll: it
immediately re-fetches the balance and loan listing and keeps trying right
away with fresh data.

Reuses monitors.peerberry_monitor.login()/_HEADERS/PEERBERRY_EMAIL/
PEERBERRY_PASSWORD (same dependency direction as every other module that
piggybacks on the monitor - see that module's docstring) rather than
duplicating the auth flow.

PeerBerry's access_token is a short-lived JWT (login() is only ever called
ONCE at startup) - a real run on 2026-07-23 showed it expiring mid-run,
after which EVERY poll got HTTP 401 for the rest of that run (1621/5167
polls errored, all in one unbroken tail once the token expired, 0
investments possible). Fixed via `_call_with_reauth()`: fetch_loans()/
fetch_available_money() calls are wrapped so a 401 triggers exactly one
re-login() (fresh token) + one retry before being treated as a real error;
attempt_investment()'s POST does the same inline (re-login + retry once on
a 401 response) before counting it as a failed investment attempt.

Endpoints used, all pure HTTP (`requests`, no browser needed), discovered
via one-off, read-only/network-intercepted Playwright explorations on
2026-07-22 (see repo memory for full details):
  - `GET /v2/investor/profile` -> `publicId` (a UUID), needed to build the
    loans-listing URL below (NOT the same as `accountId`, also present in
    that response).
  - `GET /v1/{publicId}/loans` with `hideInvested`/`groupGuarantee`/
    `minInterestRate`/`maxRemainingTerm`/`minRemainingTerm` filters (see
    `build_loans_params()`) -> `{"data": [...], "total": N, ...}`. Only the
    field names are known (from the response's own `sort` mapping):
    `loanId`, `countryId`, `loanOriginator`, `issuedDate`,
    `termTypeTitle`/`termType`, `interestRate`, `term`, `availableToInvest`.
    NO server-side `loanOriginators[]` id filter is sent anymore (removed
    for good 2026-07-31, after being removed 2026-07-28, restored
    2026-07-29, then proven to break again - see `build_loans_params()`'s
    own docstring for the full story) - originator selection happens
    100% client-side by name.
  - `GET /v1/investor/overview` -> `availableMoney` (same as
    peerberry_monitor.fetch_available_money()) - re-fetched periodically to
    track remaining funds across investment attempts within a single run.
  - `POST /v1/loans/{loanId}` with `{"amount": "<string>"}` (see
    `attempt_investment()`) - the real invest submission call, CONFIRMED via
    a network-interception exploration (clicked Invest -> confirmed "Yes" on
    the "Assignment Agreement" popup -> the resulting request was
    intercepted and aborted before ever reaching the server, so no real
    money was spent). This is NOT the previously-guessed
    `/v1/investor/loans/{loanId}/invest` shape.

Which originator actually gets INVESTED IN (and how much budget it gets)
is driven 100% by the Google Sheet - there is no server-side id filter
anymore, so a newly-selected Sheet originator is always visible to the bot
(subject only to pagination, see the `total > pageSize` log warning).
shared.google_sheet.get_selected_peerberry_loan_originators() finds the
"Répartition géographique" cell, then the "Peerberry" cell below it (same
column) - every row between "Peerberry" and the next "Swaper" cell (both
excluded) is a PeerBerry loan originator, and any of those rows whose cell
one column to the LEFT equals "x" (case-insensitive) is selected. A loan
whose `loanOriginator` doesn't match any selected name (see
`_match_selected_originator()`) is skipped entirely.

There is NO per-originator budget split anymore (removed 2026-07-31, see
git history for the previous equal-split-in-MIN_INVESTMENT_AMOUNT-blocks
design) - a matching, non-blocked (see the per-country cap below) loan
simply draws `min(available_money, loan's own availableToInvest)`, same
shared pot for every selected originator. The only investment caps left
are the overall `available_money`/MIN_INVESTMENT_AMOUNT floor and the
per-country threshold described next.

Per-country investment cap: no single country may end up holding more than
`country_threshold_percentage`% of the TOTAL PeerBerry budget (everything
currently invested across EVERY loan originator on the account, summed
live via `fetch_originator_invested_amounts()` at startup - not just the
selected ones - plus the available/not-yet-invested balance). Both the
percentage AND each country's currently-invested amount are read ONCE from
the Google Sheet at startup, by
`shared.google_sheet.get_peerberry_country_allocations()`:
`threshold_percentage` is the value in the cell 2 columns to the left of
"Peerberry" on ITS OWN row (one column further left than the
`minInterestRate` cell read by `get_peerberry_min_interest_rate()` - that
cell is otherwise used as the "x" selection flag for the loan-originator
rows below, but is free on the "Peerberry" row itself); `country_amounts`
is read directly off that same "Peerberry" row, one value per country
column (found dynamically as every non-empty column header on the
"Répartition géographique" row); `originator_countries` (loan originator
name -> country name) is derived from each loan-originator sub-row's own
SINGLE non-empty country column (every PeerBerry loan originator only
ever operates in one country). Once a country's tracked invested total
reaches/exceeds its threshold, EVERY loan for that country - among
selected originators only, see `_match_selected_originator()` - gets
skipped (0 EUR) for the REST of the run, even if a later resync would
show a lower figure (sticky, see `_update_blocked_countries()`). The
Google Sheet itself is never read again after startup: per-country totals
are kept up to date purely from the live API - immediately on this bot's
own successful investments, and resynced from scratch every
`EXTERNAL_INVESTMENT_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS` via a periodic
`fetch_originator_invested_amounts()` call (folding in anything external
too, e.g. PeerBerry's own "Auto-Invest EASY" scheme or a real human) - see
`_group_invested_by_country()`. If the Sheet's threshold percentage cell
is empty (or the Sheet read fails outright), country blocking is disabled
for that run (soft-fail, same as `MIN_INTEREST_RATE` above) rather than
aborting it.

If the available balance seen at startup is already below
MIN_INVESTMENT_AMOUNT, `run()` stops right away (no polling at all, not
even reading the Google Sheet) instead of burning the whole
DURATION_SECONDS window for nothing - this is a normal/expected state
(e.g. right after a previous run already invested everything), NOT an
error: the usual summary email is still sent (0 polls, 0 attempts, exit
code 0), just so this is visible/confirmed rather than silent. The same
early-stop applies mid-run: if the balance drops below
MIN_INVESTMENT_AMOUNT at any point (e.g. it just got fully invested),
the poll loop exits right after that
poll instead of continuing to burn the rest of DURATION_SECONDS with no
possible investment left to make.

Diagnostics (full request/response detail for every real investment
attempt, every error case - including the real exception message AND
traceback, not just a generic label - AND a final "run_summary" entry with
the complete end-of-run stats dict) are written ONLY to DIAGNOSTICS_FILE,
never to stdout/the GitHub Actions console log, and persisted across runs
via `actions/cache` (NOT `actions/upload-artifact`) in the workflow - see
.github/workflows/peerberry-invest-bot.yml and repo memory
(2026-07-22 "Design decisions confirmed with user") for why cache (not a
public-repo-visible artifact) is the safe choice here: this repo has no
`pull_request`-triggered workflow anywhere, so there's no fork/outsider-
controllable code path that could ever read the cache. Since there's no
practical way to browse `actions/cache` content by hand (unlike
artifacts, there's no "Download" button), `run()` also collects THIS
run's own diagnostics entries (`_collect_run_diagnostics()`, filtered by
timestamp) and attaches them as a `.log` file directly on the end-of-run
summary email - so the full detail is available by email without ever
needing to touch the cache. The loan listing looking "stuck"
(unchanged/empty for STUCK_AFTER_SECONDS) is tallied in
`stats["stuck_events"]` (shown in the summary email) AND, since 2026-07-28,
also gets a LIGHTWEIGHT `"stuck"` diagnostics entry (poll number, total,
request duration, how long it's been stuck) written to DIAGNOSTICS_FILE -
NOT the full loan listing response, just enough to prove the request kept
succeeding (200 OK, genuinely empty/unchanged) throughout a long
"nothing matches" stretch, rather than a silent hang/broken loop. (Earlier
versions of this module wrote nothing at all for "stuck" - removed after a
real run showed 119 stuck_events with a totally empty diagnostics file,
leaving no way to confirm the polls were actually running vs. silently
broken.) Conversely, whenever `GET
/v1/{publicId}/loans` DOES return >=1 loan (whether or not it ends up
matching a selected originator), the full raw response (every loan
object, plus the request's own round-trip duration) is written to
DIAGNOSTICS_FILE as a `"loans_found"` entry - this is the proof that the
request itself works and lets a real loan's exact field values (and how
long the call took) be inspected after the fact, e.g. to check whether the
`selected_originators`/`minInterestRate`/`maxRemainingTerm` filters actually
match what's expected, or whether request latency is why a fast-moving
loan was missed. `poll_error`/`balance_refresh_error` entries also now
include `request_duration_seconds` for the same latency-diagnosis reason.

                                               are unaffected) - kept short
                                               since the market moves fast
                                               and a re-opened loan
                                               shouldn't be missed for long

def build_loans_params() -> dict:
    """Send only the generic, sheet-independent filters - NO
    `loanOriginators[]` server-side id filter anymore. Which originators
    actually count is decided 100% client-side, by NAME, against the
    Google-Sheet-driven selection (`selected_originators`, matched via
    `_match_selected_originator()`).

    History: an earlier version had a hardcoded 39-ID `loanOriginators[]`
    list that was completely disconnected from the Sheet-driven originator
    SELECTION - a real run then showed 0 loans_seen across ~90 minutes
    while the user was manually seeing/investing on the site at the same
    time, so the id-based filter was removed 2026-07-28 to stop that silent
    structural exclusion. It was RESTORED 2026-07-29 (a fresh 40-id list,
    claimed to be verified against the user's own live filter panel).

    REMOVED AGAIN 2026-07-31: a real run (22413 polls, ~75 minutes, right
    after the 2026-07-30 `hideInvested` fix) again showed `total=0` on
    EVERY single poll for all 33 currently-selected Sheet originators (0
    errors, request durations normal ~0.12-0.2s) - the exact same symptom
    as the 2026-07-28 bug, strongly indicating the 2026-07-29 40-id list
    does not actually cover all 33 names currently selected in the Sheet.
    Since there is no reliable way to keep a hardcoded id list in sync with
    an ever-changing Sheet selection, the server-side id filter is REMOVED
    for good this time - only sheet-independent constraints
    (`groupGuarantee`/`minInterestRate`/`maxRemainingTerm`/`minRemainingTerm`/
    `sort`/`pageSize`) are sent, and `_match_selected_originator()` alone
    decides which loans matter. The `LOAN_ORIGINATORS` constant is now
    unused dead code, kept only for historical reference - do not re-add a
    `loanOriginators[]` param to this function without a real, freshly
    re-verified id list AND a plan to keep it in sync, given this has now
    silently broken the bot twice.

    UPDATED 2026-07-30: `hideInvested` REMOVED entirely (was `"true"`), per
    the user's fresh reference URL - a run with `hideInvested=true` still
    active saw `total=0` on every single one of 22272 polls (~75 minutes),
    confirming that param no longer (if it ever did) matches the user's
    real site filter panel.

    UPDATED 2026-07-30 (later same day): `minInterestRate` now comes from
    `MIN_INTEREST_RATE` (read once at startup in run() from the Sheet cell
    just left of "Peerberry" - see get_peerberry_min_interest_rate()),
    instead of a hardcoded 8.5, so the user can change it from the Sheet
    without a code edit.

    FIXED 2026-08-03: `groupGuarantee` was sent as the string `"true"`,
    which does NOT match the module docstring's own reference URL
    (`groupGuarantee=1`) - changed to the literal `1` to match exactly.
    NOTE: a live side-by-side test against the real API right after this
    change showed `"true"` and `1` return the IDENTICAL total/loan set -
    so this was NOT actually the cause of the `total=0` runs, just a
    latent inconsistency worth fixing anyway. The real cause, confirmed
    the same day via a live, unfiltered call to the same endpoint: the
    entire PeerBerry marketplace only had 9 loans total at that moment,
    ALL with `remainingTerm` of 361 or 702 days - i.e. none could ever
    pass `maxRemainingTerm=185` regardless of `groupGuarantee`/
    `minInterestRate`/originator selection. `total=0` for a long stretch
    is therefore expected/correct behavior when the market is this thin
    relative to the configured criteria, not a bug in the request
    itself."""
