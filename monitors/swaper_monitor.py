"""Swaper loan monitor.

Logs into swaper.com with Playwright, fetches the available loans and the
uninvested account balance via the site's own API (using the authenticated
browser session so cookies are sent automatically), and sends an email
notification only once per positive-balance cycle: when balance is > 0 and
at least one manual loan is available. No further notifications are sent while
balance stays > 0 at the same amount. The notification gate is reset when
balance drops back to 0 or when the balance amount changes.

Required env vars:
    SWAPER_EMAIL, SWAPER_PASSWORD          -> Swaper account credentials
    SMTP_HOST, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASSWORD,   -> outgoing mail server
    EMAIL_TO                               -> notification recipient
Optional:
    SMTP_PORT (default 587), EMAIL_FROM (default SMTP_USER)
    SWAPER_TOTP_SECRET                     -> base32 secret used to set up
                                               Google Authenticator, needed
                                               if 2FA is enabled on the account
    SWAPER_CRON_JOB_ID                     -> cron-job.org job id: used to

REAL auto-invest bot (added 2026-07-25, explicit user decision - real money,
no more click-and-abort safety net): does a SINGLE discovery+invest pass per
run, same principle as lendermarket_monitor.py's invest_selected_lenders()
(removed 2026-09-10, was previously a continuous in-run loop added
2026-08-01 - explicit user request to drop it: "je ne veux pas de boucle qui
check en boucle"). If nothing is available/investable this run, the run
simply stops and the next externally-triggered run (cron-job.org) checks
again - no waiting/retrying inside the same process. If an unexpected error
occurs anywhere during login/discovery/investing, the bot stops immediately
(never keeps retrying blindly) and the run's summary email is STILL sent at
the end no matter what (with the error included in its body) - see
`run_error` in `run()`.
For each available loan (in listing
order), it fills the row's amount input with min(money left, loan's own
amount) and clicks its real "+" icon - a REAL click that really reaches
Swaper's server (nothing is blocked/aborted anymore). The real request AND
response of each investment call are passively captured by the already-
registered `_record_api_response()` listener. A summary
(shared.notifier.send_swaper_investment_summary_email()) is emailed every
time at least one investment was attempted (not one-time - real money moves
every time). Swaper DOES show a `#loan-confirmation-slider` confirmation
modal after clicking "+" (first observed 2026-08-01 - the module used to
assume no such modal existed) - `_invest_available_loans()` now clicks its
real "Confirm" button too (explicit user decision 2026-08-01: "le bot doit
investir", real money) instead of stopping there. If the modal's "Confirm"
button can't be found/clicked, or any other unrecognized UI appears,
investing still stops immediately rather than guessing, and the modal's
HTML is included in the summary for manual review.

CURRENT BEHAVIOR (supersedes every sheet/split description below): the robot
is configured entirely by the "config robots" Google Sheet (see
shared/robot_config.py: active originators, min/max rate, per-country and
per-originator caps in % of balance + invested, min/max amount per
investment, equal split flag), with already-invested amounts read from
"Répartition géographique" (shared.google_sheet.get_geo_platform_snapshot()).
The investment amounts of a run come from robot_config.plan_allocations();
the functions/sheet readers named below that no longer exist
(get_selected_swaper_loan_originators(), get_swaper_min_interest_rate(),
get_swaper_country_allocations(), get_swaper_originator_caps(),
_compute_swaper_loan_shares()) are kept in this text for history only.

Per-originator filtering + budget split (added 2026-07-25, same day, per
explicit user request - mirrors the PeerBerry/Lendermarket "x" flag
convention in the Google Sheet): instead of investing into the aggregate/
unfiltered loan list, only the loan originators flagged with "x" in the
Google Sheet (shared.google_sheet.get_selected_swaper_loan_originators(),
reading the block between the "Swaper" and "Crowdlending savings" cells)
are considered. Each selected originator is checked individually for
CURRENT loan availability via `fetch_loans_for_originator()`, which uses
swaper.com's own "Loan originators" filter - NOT by driving the site's
custom JS multiselect dropdown widget (reverse-engineering its click/
toggle behaviour turned out to be unreliable - see repo memory), but by
intercepting the page's own outgoing `/rest/public/loans` request via
`page.route()` and rewriting its JSON body to add
`"groups": [originator_name]` before letting it through unmodified
otherwise (confirmed via real DevTools captures, provided directly by the
user, that the endpoint accepts the originator's plain display name
directly - not an opaque id). The available balance is then split EVENLY
across only the originators that currently have >=1 loan available (see
`_split_budget_across_available_originators()`: 1 originator with loans ->
gets the full balance, 2 -> 50/50 each, etc. - per explicit user spec), and
`_invest_available_loans()` is called once per such originator with its
own budget cap.

Per-loan share computation, no sub-minimum leftover (added 2026-07-25,
same day, explicit user request - "je ne veux pas de reste < 10e"):
within one originator's own budget, loans are no longer filled greedily
in listing order (which could strand an unusable remainder below
MIN_INVESTMENT_AMOUNT once the last loan couldn't fully absorb what was
left). `_compute_swaper_loan_shares()` (exact same algorithm as
monitors/lendermarket_monitor.py's `_compute_loan_shares()`) instead
splits an originator's budget EQUALLY across its own currently available
loans, capping any loan whose own `amount` is smaller than its equal
share (redistributing the excess across the other loans in the same
pass), and drops loans from consideration if the equal share would fall
below the minimum (funding fewer loans instead, each still getting at
least the minimum) - so a budget only goes unspent within one originator
if that originator's own loans genuinely can't absorb it all (originators
remain fully independent of each other, no cross-originator
redistribution, matching the same accepted design already used for
Lendermarket's lenders). `_invest_available_loans()` now takes this
precomputed `{loan_id: amount}` share map directly and targets each
loan's specific row by its visible `number` (rather than always
`rows.first`, which assumed - only true for the old greedy-fill logic -
that an invested loan's row always disappears/reorders predictably;
under equal-split most loans are only PARTIALLY invested and stay
visible, so the specific row must be targeted precisely).

The earlier one-time "invest-structure exploration" capture (HTML dump of
the loans page + a dedicated one-time email, added 2026-07-23 to help
figure out how to build the invest bot before it existed) was removed on
2026-07-25 once the real bot above was built and confirmed working - it
ended up implemented via real Playwright UI clicks, not a reconstructed
HTTP call, so that exploration data was no longer needed. The passive
`/rest/` API call capture (`_record_api_response()`/`captured_api_calls`)
is KEPT - it now only feeds the real investment summary email, to verify
each real investment call actually succeeded.

Balance-independent per-originator availability check (added 2026-07-26,
explicit user request - "j'ai pas besoin d'attendre d'avoir des sous sur
mon compte pour te donner tout ce dont tu auras besoin"): each selected
originator's current loan availability is now checked via
`fetch_loans_for_originator()` EVERY run regardless of the account
balance - only the actual investing step (budget split + real clicks)
stays gated behind `balance_now >= MIN_INVESTMENT_AMOUNT`. This means the
passive `/rest/` capture above always has loans-listing/filter API calls
to show, even on a run with nothing to invest. A diagnostics email
(`shared.notifier.send_swaper_api_structure_email()`) ships that captured
structure without waiting for a real investment, gated on there being at
least one loan available for a selected originator AND balance >=
MIN_INVESTMENT_AMOUNT (2026-07-26 follow-up requests) - it's skipped if a
real investment summary email was sent instead this run (a strict
superset). No anti-spam cooldown (removed 2026-07-26, explicit user
request) - it's sent every run those conditions hold. The real
invest-call structure itself still can't be observed without a real
investment actually happening (real money moving, per the 2026-07-25
decision to drop click-and-abort captures).

Sheet-driven minInterestRate + per-country cap (added 2026-07-31, mirrors
the same feature already built for Lendermarket): `shared.google_sheet.
get_swaper_min_interest_rate()`/`get_swaper_country_allocations()` read
the same cell layout convention as PeerBerry/Lendermarket (cell 1 column
left of "Swaper" itself = minInterestRate, 2 columns left = per-country
cap threshold %). Unlike PeerBerry/Lendermarket, Swaper's
`/rest/public/loans` endpoint has no known/verified server-side
interest-rate filter param, so `_filter_loans_by_min_interest_rate()`
applies it client-side on each fetched loan's `interestRatePerYear`
instead. The per-country cap is checked ONCE per run (not continuously
re-polled, same one-shot design as Lendermarket's): an originator whose
mapped country is already at/above `threshold_percentage`% of the total
Swaper budget (balance + every country's already-invested amount) is
excluded entirely from this run's budget split, tracked in
`country_blocked_originators` and shown in
`send_swaper_investment_summary_email()`'s body alongside the
minInterestRate used and a per-country invested/threshold breakdown. Both
Sheet reads are soft-fail (fall back to the module default / disable
country blocking on a read error), same pattern as every other soft-fail
Sheet read in this repo.

Greedy fill-in-order across originators + loans (changed 2026-09-19,
explicit user request after reviewing a real investment summary email
where a 136.82 EUR balance only got 13.57 EUR + 63.53 EUR invested because
of the 2026-07-25 equal-split design: "je ne veux pas de part égale, il
met tout le solde qu'il peut sur les prêts qu'il trouve et si plusieurs
prêts il met ce qu'il peut sur le premier ensuite le deuxième etc"). Both
the per-originator split (`_split_budget_across_available_originators()`,
removed) and the per-loan equal split (`_compute_swaper_loan_shares()`'s
old algorithm) are gone. Originators with >=1 loan available are now
visited in their natural order (`_available_originators_in_order()` -
the order they were discovered in, i.e. the Google Sheet's selected-
originators order), each offered the FULL remaining balance rather than
a fixed pre-split share. Within one originator, `_compute_swaper_loan_shares()`
now fills its available loans GREEDILY in listing order: loan 1 gets
min(remaining_budget, loan 1's own `amount`), loan 2 gets
min(what's left, loan 2's own `amount`), etc., stopping once the budget
drops below MIN_INVESTMENT_AMOUNT or loans run out. Whatever budget a
given originator's loans can't absorb carries over to the next originator
(`remaining_budget` in `run()`), instead of being stranded as that
originator's own unspent leftover. Net effect: as much of the balance as
possible gets placed, and within any originator earlier-listed loans are
filled before later ones instead of everyone getting an equal slice. A
same-day follow-up request ("je ne veux plus le Priorité par originator
enlève le") dropped an initial version of this change that also
prioritized "Wandoo Finance Group" ahead of every other originator - that
priority ordering (`PRIORITY_LOAN_ORIGINATORS`/`_order_originators_by_priority()`)
was removed again a few minutes later; originators are visited in plain
discovery order, with no special-cased name.

Post-login flow switched to pure HTTP (added 2026-08-01, explicit user
request for speed - "login en playwright et après le reste en pur http"):
`login()` still drives a real Playwright browser (the only step genuinely
gated by Swaper's reCAPTCHA v3, confirmed 2026-07-26 - see repo memory),
but everything afterward (loan-listing/filter polling AND the real invest
calls) now goes through a plain `requests.Session()` seeded with the
login's cookies (`_build_http_session()`), instead of driving the UI via
`page.goto()`/clicks. `fetch_loans()` is now a single function (an HTTP
POST, optionally filtered via `groups`) replacing the old
`fetch_loans()`/`fetch_loans_for_originator()`/`fetch_loans_fast()` trio -
there's no more "slow reload vs fast in-page fetch" distinction since a
plain request is already fast. `_invest_available_loans()` no longer
clicks the amount input/"+" icon/Confirm button - it replicates the 2 real
calls a real investment fires (confirmed from a real successful capture,
2026-08-01): `GET /rest/public/profile/is-manual-investment-approved`
(must return `true`) then `POST /rest/public/loans/{id}/buy` with
`{"amount": <float>}` - there is NO separate "confirm" API call, the
browser's confirmation modal is purely a UI safety step, so these 2 calls
are the whole real flow, not a guess. The browser/context stay open for
the whole run only to persist `storage_state` at the end.

REVERTED (2026-08-01, later same day, real GitHub Actions failure): the
plain `requests.Session()` approach above is now BLOCKED by Cloudflare -
a real run got `403 Forbidden` on the very first `fetch_loans()` call
right after a successful Playwright login, and the SAME 403 recurred
identically after `_relogin_and_rebuild_session()` logged back in again
(login itself succeeded both times - "Reused a previous session, already
logged in" - only the plain-HTTP calls failed). This is the exact same
fingerprint-based Cloudflare bot-fight-mode pattern already documented in
repo memory for Bricks (a naive non-browser client gets blocked even with
valid session cookies, while the identical call through a real automated
Chromium succeeds) - swaper.com is also Cloudflare-fronted (`Server:
cloudflare`, `CF-RAY` present on the 403 responses). FIX: every post-login
call (`fetch_loans()`, the manual-investment-approval check, the buy call)
now goes through `page.evaluate(fetch(...))` - the real browser's own
fetch(), same-origin, cookies attached automatically - instead of a
separate `requests.Session()`. `_build_http_session()`/`_xsrf_headers()`
were replaced by `page.goto()`-driven navigation for the loans listing and
real UI clicks for investing (see `fetch_loans()`/`_invest_available_loans()`);
`login()`
stays exactly as before (still the only step needing a real browser for
its own reCAPTCHA-related reasons). No more session cookie syncing needed
at the end of the run since the browser context IS the source of truth
throughout.

    throwaway test (nonexistent loan_id + a below-minimum amount, so no real
    money could ever move) confirmed Swaper's WAF returns 403 for a manually
    built request to BOTH `is-manual-investment-approved` AND `.../buy`, the
    exact same block already found on `fetch_loans()` - the real click flow
    is the only way these calls actually succeed. Both real requests fire as
    a side effect of the click sequence below and are captured passively by
    the `page.on("response", ...)` listener registered in `run()` (see

    Ported verbatim from the last pre-pure-HTTP commit (`cc26b84`) rather

    Each loan's row is targeted by its visible `number` (NOT always
    `rows.first`) since a loan given only a PARTIAL share (the normal case
    under equal-split) stays visible afterwards rather than
    disappearing/reordering - skipped (not fatal) if its row can't be found

    modal after clicking "+"; the modal detection itself uses a generic
    CSS query (modal/dialog/toast/snackbar/popup/confirm classes) rather
    than hardcoding that one ID, since that selector is unverified against
    every possible UI variant - the row's own outerHTML right after the
    click is ALSO always captured as a fallback, so whatever appeared is
    visible in the summary email even if not recognized as a "modal" here.
    Stops attempting further loans as soon as a modal was shown but
    couldn't be confirmed (real money on the line, never guesses which
    button to click) - keeps going to the next loan only if clicking "+"
