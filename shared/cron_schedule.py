"""Shared cron-job.org schedule coordinator.

Swaper and Lendermarket each run in their own GitHub Actions workflow,
triggered by their own separate cron-job.org job (see
.github/workflows/swaper.yml and .github/workflows/lendermarket.yml), and
both want the same behavior: poll faster while there's a positive balance to
invest (to catch fleeting loan availability), and slower otherwise. This
module owns the mechanics of talking to cron-job.org's API and remembering
which schedule is currently applied - the job ID and the state file are
passed in by each caller since they're per-monitor, only the API key and the
patching mechanics are shared here.

Re-added 2026-09-09 (was previously disabled/commented out for Swaper),
then REWORKED 2026-09-10 (cron-job.org's account is capped at 100 API
requests/day, and the earlier design burned through that budget fast):
`ensure_schedule()` now only PATCHes cron-job.org when `mode` actually
differs from the last known mode in `state_file` - staying in the same mode
across runs costs zero API calls. The cron-job.org schedule itself is now a
plain, FIXED interval per mode (every 2min / every 30min, no jitter) - the
anti-robotic-cadence randomness moved to `apply_startup_jitter()` instead,
a short random sleep each monitor calls once at the very start of its own
`run()`, sized from the SAME JITTER_RANGE_MINUTES_2M/30M ranges (now in
minutes of SLEEP, not minutes added to the cron timer).

Required env var (missing -> calls are logged and skipped, never raise):
    CRON_JOB_API_KEY
Optional:
    CRON_JOB_TIMEZONE (default Europe/Paris)
