"""Waterfall (successive-palier) decomposition of the XIRR gap, walked from
a TRUE 0%-return baseline up to the real XIRR - so the shares sum EXACTLY
to the real XIRR (not to an arbitrary "all factors neutralized" gap).

Added 2026-09-09 as an ALTERNATIVE to shared/xirr_shapley.py's Shapley-value
decomposition, for side-by-side comparison only - NOT wired into any
*_diversification.py script (see _compare_shapley_vs_waterfall.py).

Unlike shared/xirr_shapley.py (which neutralizes factors FROM the real
value - its "all neutralized" reference point is generally NOT a 0% return,
because e.g. cancelling "Intérêts" via `-net_interest` while also having a
separate "Taxes" term double-counts the tax, and "Cash drag" is a
hypothetical missed-earnings amount that was never really in the account),
this walks UP from a literal 0% baseline (get back exactly the net capital
deposited, no more no less) by ADDING each step's real delta in a FIXED
order, so that:
    share(step_k) = XIRR(cumulative through step_k) - XIRR(cumulative through step_{k-1})
telescopes to `sum(shares) == XIRR_real - 0% == XIRR_real` ALWAYS - any
reconciliation gap between the steps' own deltas and the real `base_value`
(logged as a warning, see value_tolerance below) is folded into the FIRST
step's own delta before the walk starts, so it can never leak into
"sum(shares) != XIRR real" NOR silently flip the sign of an unrelated,
smaller category (e.g. "XIRR Taxes") the way absorbing it into the LAST
step used to (a real bug found 2026-09-09). E.g. for the
"intérêts -> cash drag -> bonus -> frais -> taxes" order: use GROSS
interest (not net) at the "Intérêts" step, then SUBTRACT the missed-
earnings amount at "Cash drag" (real cost of idle cash pulling the ideal
gross interest back down to what was actually earned), then add bonus,
subtract fees, subtract withholding tax last - each euro is counted
exactly once, and any leftover reconciliation slop lands in the first
step ("Intérêts" here, normally the largest/most sign-robust category).

    """Decompose XIRR into one additive share per step, walking `steps`
    (an ORDERED list of (name, delta) pairs) from a true 0%-return baseline.

    Each step's delta is added on top of the running cumulative value -
    unlike shared/xirr_shapley.py's `factor_deltas`, these are NOT
    "neutralize from the real value" adjustments; they're real amounts
    that build UP from 0 to `base_value`. The steps' own deltas are
    expected to reconstruct `base_value` almost exactly by design, but in
    practice a small reconciliation gap (unreconciled EUR here or there,
    see `value_tolerance`) is common - rather than letting that leak into
    whichever step happens to be LAST in the caller's list (which used to
    silently corrupt/flip the sign of a small, unrelated category like
    "XIRR Taxes" - a real bug found 2026-09-09), any such gap is folded
    into the FIRST step's own delta before the walk starts. Every caller
    puts the (normally largest, sign-robust) interest step first, so a
    small reconciliation gap there barely nudges its own share and never
    contaminates an unrelated, smaller category's sign. This guarantees
    the returned shares always sum EXACTLY to the real XIRR.

    Returns {step_name: waterfall_share_or_None}, same soft-fail convention
    as compute_shapley_xirr_shares (None only if some step's XIRR couldn't
    be solved).
