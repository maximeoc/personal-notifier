"""Swaper portfolio "loan originator breakdown" fetcher.

Same family as afranga_diversification.py / peerberry_diversification.py /
lendermarket_diversification.py / loanch_diversification.py: logs into
swaper.com (reusing swaper_monitor.login(), which already handles
email/password + TOTP 2FA - not duplicated here) and reads the "Loan
Originator Breakdown" widget on the Open Investments page
(https://swaper.com/en/investments/open-investments), which shows one
percentage per loan originator (e.g. "Wandoo Finance Group 14.44%", "SW
Finance 85.56%") plus the total currently allocated/invested amount (e.g.
"5076.18 €"). The per-originator EUR amount isn't shown directly, so it's
computed as `total_invested * percentage / 100`, per the user's own
instructions. No email is sent - the amounts are just logged and handed to
fill_current_month_amounts() (see google_sheet.py) so they can
be filled into a Google Sheet, mirroring the other *_diversification.py
scripts.

Widget markup verified against the real account on 2026-07-09 (a Recharts
pie chart + legend, both under `.statistics-pie-card`):
- The card whose `.title` is "Loan Originator Breakdown" contains a
  `.statistics-pie-bottom-container` with one `.statistics-legend-container`
  per originator: `<div class="statistics-pill-container">...<pill/>Wandoo
  Finance Group</div><div>14.44%</div>` - the originator name is the
  `.statistics-pill-container`'s own text (after the empty colored-pill
  div), the percentage is the container's second child `<div>`.
- The total invested amount is in a separate `.statistics-value-container`
  widget: `<div class="amount-text">5076.18 €</div><div
  class="value-text">Currently Allocated</div>` - found via the
  `.value-text` div whose text is "Currently Allocated", value read from
  its previous sibling `.amount-text`.

Also fetches this calendar month's "Interest Received" from the Account
Statement page (https://swaper.com/en/investments/account-statement) - see
fetch_current_month_interest_received() below, same idea as
loanch_diversification.fetch_current_month_statement_totals().

Also computes a since-inception XIRR (money-weighted return) plus this
month's Cash drag and the XIRR Bonus / XIRR Cash drag / XIRR Taxes/Frais /
XIRR Intérêts pie-chart shares (see run() below, and
afranga_diversification.py's own docstring for the full since-inception
XIRR methodology, shared across every *_diversification.py that computes
it).

Added 2026-08-19: XIRR Intérêts, the counterfactual XIRR share
attributable to real net interest received since inception (mirrors
afranga_diversification.py's/peerberry_diversification.py's own XIRR
Intérêts block exactly - same counterfactual-XIRR pattern as Bonus/Cash
drag/Taxes above). Like PeerBerry (and unlike Afranga, which has a real
gross/withholding-tax split to subtract), Swaper's account-entries API has
no withholding-tax data at all (taxes_xirr_contribution is hardcoded to
0.0 above for the same reason) - so `lifetime_statement_totals["earned_interest"]`
already IS the lifetime net interest figure, used directly as
`lifetime_net_interest`, no extra fetch/subtraction needed. As with
Afranga/PeerBerry, a "XIRR Intérêts" row must already exist in the Swaper
block on the sheet itself (right after "XIRR Taxes/Frais") for this new
value to land anywhere - fill_current_month_bonus_breakdown() fills an
existing row by label, it doesn't insert new labelled rows. `max_rows` is
bumped 18 -> 19 to keep the search bounded past this now-taller block.

Added 2026-09-07: this whole XIRR/Cash drag block can now also be computed
for a BACKFILLED (past) REPORT_DATE month, not just the real current
month - mirrors afranga_diversification.py's own
reconstruct_outstanding()/compute_xirr_block_as_of() pattern: outstanding
("Currently Allocated") is reconstructed for an arbitrary past end_date by
replaying every account-entries row's effect on invested principal
(reconstruct_outstanding()/_outstanding_delta_for_entry()), and the
terminal value is that reconstructed outstanding + the account-entries
API's own closing_balance for that date. "XIRR Bonus" is DELIBERATELY
still current-month-only - fetch_referral_bonus_earned() has no per-date
breakdown (a single lifetime total), so it can't be reconstructed "as of"
a past date without risking a wrong number - see
compute_xirr_block_as_of()'s docstring.

Added 2026-09-09: switched the XIRR Bonus/Cash drag/Intérêts shares from
isolated counterfactuals (cancel ONE factor, XIRR_real - XIRR_without that
factor) to a proper Shapley-value decomposition (see
shared/xirr_shapley.py's module docstring) - the old method left an
unexplained gap between XIRR and the sum of its "explaining" shares
because XIRR is non-linear in its cashflows (interaction effects between
factors were silently dropped). Shapley shares are additive by
construction. Also split the old single "XIRR Taxes/Frais" share into
"XIRR Taxes" and "XIRR Frais" - Swaper has neither withholding tax nor a
distinct fee concept at all, so BOTH are hardcoded to 0.0 (not computed
via Shapley, never part of the game).

    Verified against the real account on 2026-07-10:

    1. Clicking the "This Month" quick filter on the Account Statement tab
       sends `POST https://swaper.com/rest/public/profile/account-entries`

       the 1st of the current month through TODAY (not the full calendar
       month like Loanch's equivalent filter) - reproduced here the same
       way. "Last Month" was also captured for comparison and confirmed to
       use the full previous month's first/last day instead.
    2. The response's `earnedInterest` field (12.19 for July 2026) matched
       the "Interest Received" figure shown in the summary card exactly
       (the other cards - "Bought Loans", "Sold Loans", "Deducted Taxes" -
       map to the response's `investments`/`soldInvestments`/`taxes` fields
       respectively, not used here since only Interest Received was asked
       for).
    3. This endpoint is CSRF-protected (plain `fetch(..., {credentials:
       'include'})` alone gets HTTP 403 "Forbidden") - unlike every other
       *_diversification.py's API calls so far. The required
       `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header value is NOT in a readable cookie (it's not
       exposed via `document.cookie` at all despite the header's name) -
       it's mirrored into `localStorage['X-XSRF-TOKEN']` (a JSON-quoted
       string) by the site's own JS, read from there instead.

    Also returns this SAME response's `openingBalance`/`closingBalance`
    fields (verified live 2026-08-14: `closingBalance` for a range ending
    today matches the live uninvested "non investi" balance exactly, e.g.
    8.19 EUR both ways) - the real uninvested-cash balance at the start/end
    of the queried range, needed by run() to compute the "Cash drag" row
