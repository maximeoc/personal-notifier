"""Loanch portfolio diversification (by loan originator) fetcher.

Logs into loanch.com (email/password + a 6-box Google Authenticator TOTP
code, same idea as Swaper/Lendermarket/PeerBerry) and fetches every active
investment via the site's own "Mes investissements"
(https://loanch.com/fr/dashboard/investments) API, then groups them by loan
originator and sums the currently remaining (not yet repaid) principal of
every active investment per originator. It also fetches this calendar
month's "Total des interets payes" / "Total des recompenses" from the
"Releve de compte" (https://loanch.com/fr/dashboard/statement) API - see
fetch_current_month_statement_totals() below. No email is sent - the
amounts are just logged and handed to fill_current_month_amounts() (see
google_sheet.py) so they can be filled into a Google Sheet,
mirroring afranga_diversification.py / peerberry_diversification.py /
lendermarket_diversification.py.

login() logs in via loanch.com's django-allauth "headless" browser API
(https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/headless/), confirmed with a real
network capture on 2026-07-27 (Playwright script with
page.on("request")/page.on("response") listeners around the login form
submission, then double-checked with a plain `requests.Session()` replay -
see git history for the throwaway capture script if this ever needs to be
redone). The flow is:

1. `GET https://api.loanch.com/_allauth/browser/v1/auth/session` - always
   returns 401 for a logged-out session (expected, not an error), but its
   response sets the `csrftoken` cookie needed for step 2.
2. `POST https://api.loanch.com/_allauth/browser/v1/auth/login` with JSON
   body `{"email": ..., "password": ...}` and header
   `X-CSRFToken: <csrftoken cookie value>`. On success without 2FA, returns
   `200` with `meta.is_authenticated = true`. If 2FA is enabled, returns
   `401` with `data.flows` containing `{"id": "mfa_authenticate", "is_pending": true}`.
3. If 2FA is pending: `POST https://api.loanch.com/_allauth/browser/v1/auth/2fa/authenticate`
   with JSON body `{"code": "<TOTP code>"}` (same CSRF header). Returns
   `200` with `meta.is_authenticated = true` on success.

The data-fetching endpoints below (fetch_investments/
fetch_current_month_statement_totals) are a separate, already-verified
DRF API (`/api/v1/...`) that relies on the Django session cookie set by
the allauth login above - verified against the real account on
2026-07-09/07-10 (see their own docstrings).

API verified against the real account on 2026-07-09, in two steps:

1. `GET https://api.loanch.com/api/v1/investments?closed=false&ordering=-invested_date&page=N&page_size=100`
   (same list endpoint/filter the dashboard's own React app uses, fetched
   here via `credentials: 'include'` - no CORS/bearer-token issues, unlike
   PeerBerry) -> `{"count", "total_pages", "next", "previous", "results": [...]}`,
   one entry per still-active investment:
   `{"id": "...", "originator_name": "Tambadana", "amount": "146.46", "closed": false, ...}`.
   Paginates via `next`/`total_pages` defensively, even though
   `page_size=100` fit all of them in one page at the time of writing.

2. Importantly, this list's `amount` field is the ORIGINALLY invested
   amount for that investment - installment loans partially repay
   principal over time without the investment being marked `closed` until
   the very last installment, so summing `amount` over-counts the actually
   still-invested capital (verified: 656.79 EUR that way vs. 529.32 EUR
   shown as `total_invested` on `GET https://api.loanch.com/api/v1/dashboard`,
   the account's ground truth). The correct currently-outstanding amount is
   the `principal_left` field, only exposed on the per-investment detail
   endpoint `GET https://api.loanch.com/api/v1/investments/<id>` (no
   trailing slash - one extra request per active investment, confirmed to
   reproduce the 529.32 EUR total exactly when summed).

Since the account's session cookie (set at login) is shared across the
loanch.com/api.loanch.com subdomains (confirmed by the 2026-07-27 capture -
the `csrftoken` cookie set by api.loanch.com is readable via
`document.cookie` on loanch.com), a plain `requests.Session()` carries it
the same way the browser's own `fetch(..., {credentials: 'include'})`
calls did, as long as login() succeeds in setting it.

Also computes a since-inception XIRR (money-weighted return) plus this
month's Cash drag and the XIRR Bonus / XIRR Cash drag / XIRR Taxes/Frais
pie-chart shares, mirroring afranga_diversification.py/
swaper_diversification.py/peerberry_diversification.py's own XIRR block -
added 2026-08-14, per explicit user request. Unlike Lendermarket (no
per-transaction ledger at all), Loanch DOES expose a genuine per-transaction
dated ledger - the same one shown under "Transactions" on
https://loanch.com/fr/dashboard/statement - found via a real browser network
capture (login automated with LOANCH_EMAIL/PASSWORD/TOTP_SECRET from .env,
see the throwaway probe technique in git history if this ever needs to be
redone for another platform):

    GET https://api.loanch.com/api/v1/transaction?page=<N>&page_size=<N>&transaction_type=0&transaction_type=1&...&transaction_type=10
    -> {"count", "total_pages", "next", "previous", "results": [...]}, one
    entry per transaction, newest first: {"id", "transaction_type_display":
    "Placed Investment"|"Paid interest"|"Paid principal"|"Deposit"|
    "Withdrawal"|"Bonus", "transaction_type": <int>, "amount": "<already
    SIGNED for its cash-balance impact, no per-type sign lookup needed>",
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "deposit"/"withdrawal"/"investment"/"bonus"/
    "exchange": <linked object id or null>}. transaction_type is a small
    int enum - probed live 2026-08-14 by requesting each value 0-15
    individually: 0=Deposit, 1=Withdrawal, 2=Placed Investment, 3=Paid
    principal, 6=Paid interest, 10=Bonus are the ones actually observed on
    this account (summing to the API's own `count` exactly); 4/5/7/8/9 are
    valid choices (200, not 400) but had zero occurrences on this account -
    their real label is unconfirmed, so if any of them ever appear their
    total is tracked separately as "unclassified" and only logged as a
    warning (NOT folded into any XIRR Taxes/Frais share - see the
    2026-09-09 correction note below - untested at 0.00, same reasoning as
    PeerBerry's untested INVESTMENT_SALE_FEE/REFERRAL_FEE). page_size is
    capped server-side at 200 regardless of the
    value requested (verified live: page_size=500 still only returned 200
    rows/page). No date-range filter exists on this endpoint (unlike
    PeerBerry's transactions API) - pagination is by `page` only, newest
    first, so the incremental cache below stops fetching as soon as it
    reaches an already-cached transaction id instead of always re-fetching
    the entire history.

    Since Loanch's transaction ledger is fetched back to the very first
    transaction (account inception), the daily uninvested-cash balance used
    for Cash drag is reconstructed by accumulating every entry's own signed
    `amount` starting from a true zero balance at inception - no separate
    "opening balance" API call is needed (unlike PeerBerry, which seeds
    from its account-summary API's openingBalance). Loanch's own
    statement-report opening_account/closing_account fields were
    considered as that anchor but ruled out (see the loanch-login-api repo
    memory note, 2026-08-07 investigation): they match /api/v1/dashboard's
    balance_sum, which itself equals total_invested on this platform - i.e.
    they track invested capital, not idle cash despite the generic name -
    so they're not used here.

Added 2026-08-18: XIRR Intérêts, the counterfactual XIRR share
attributable to real net interest received (mirrors
bienpreter_diversification.py's/afranga_diversification.py's/
iuvo_diversification.py's/lendermarket_diversification.py's own XIRR
Intérêts blocks). Loanch has no separate gross/withholding-tax split on
interest either (interest_paid is mapped to both
gross_interest_received/net_interest_received - see below), and its "Paid
interest" transaction type (INTEREST_TYPE) is a real, already-signed
per-transaction ledger figure (unlike the "unclassified" bucket, which is
untested/probably-zero and no longer attributed to Taxes/Frais either -
see the 2026-09-09 correction note below) - so "lifetime
net interest" here is simply the sum of every INTEREST_TYPE transaction's
own `amount` since inception (`lifetime_interest_paid`, already computed
in the Cash drag lifetime block below - reused, not recomputed). This
exists because "Intérêts" was previously only ever a RESIDUAL on the
spreadsheet/dashboard side (XIRR - XIRR Bonus - XIRR Cash drag - XIRR
Taxes/Frais), which can legitimately go negative when the bonus's
counterfactual XIRR share is disproportionately large relative to the
account's real underlying (non-bonus) performance - that's not a bug,
it's the correct signal that the account's return is propped up almost
entirely by the bonus. XIRR Intérêts instead gives a genuine,
independently-measured figure (same category of computation as
Bonus/Taxes, not a derived leftover), so the two can be compared/sanity-
checked against each other on the sheet/dashboard side.

Added 2026-09-07: XIRR block support for a BACKFILLED (non-current) month,
mirroring the same correction already applied to
afranga_diversification.py (see its module docstring for the full
methodology) - previously the entire XIRR/Cash drag/Bonus/Taxes-Frais/
Intérêts block was silently skipped for any backfilled month. For a
backfilled month, the account's invested principal ("outstanding") as of
that month's own end_date is reconstructed by replaying every cached
transaction row's effect on it (reconstruct_outstanding(), classifying
each row via its `transaction_type` - "Placed Investment"/"Paid principal"
affect outstanding, everything else is wallet-only), and the terminal
account value is that reconstructed outstanding plus the wallet balance
reconstructed the same way compute_average_idle_cash() already does
(summing every entry's own signed amount from a true zero balance at
inception - no independent closing-balance API exists here to seed/cross-
check against, unlike Afranga/PeerBerry) - see compute_xirr_block_as_of().
Unlike PeerBerry's equivalent transactions API, Loanch's has no date-range
params to invert, so the transaction ledger is now fetched/cached
unconditionally (not just for current_month) - no equivalent to
PeerBerry's 2026-08-21 BUGFIX risk here.

Added 2026-09-09: switched the XIRR Bonus/Cash drag/Taxes/Intérêts shares
from isolated counterfactuals (cancel ONE factor, XIRR_real - XIRR_without
that factor) to a proper Shapley-value decomposition (see
shared/xirr_shapley.py's module docstring) - the old method left an
unexplained gap between XIRR and the sum of its "explaining" shares
because XIRR is non-linear in its cashflows (interaction effects between
factors were silently dropped). Shapley shares are additive by
construction: XIRR Bonus + XIRR Cash drag + XIRR Taxes + XIRR Frais + XIRR
Intérêts now sums back to XIRR real - XIRR with every factor neutralized
(checked at runtime, warns if off by more than 0.0001). Also split the old
single "XIRR Taxes/Frais" share into "XIRR Taxes" and "XIRR Frais" -
Loanch has no separate withholding-tax split at all, so both are
hardcoded to 0.0, not computed via Shapley.

Corrected 2026-09-09: the "unclassified" transaction_type catch-all
(4/5/7/8/9, never observed on this account) used to be folded into "XIRR
Taxes" - dropped, since that's not a confirmed real tax and mislabelling
it as one is incorrect. If it's ever non-zero, `run()` now just logs a
warning (lifetime_unclassified) instead of silently attributing it to
Taxes.

       - i.e. the entire calendar month (first day to last day), not
       "start of month to today" as one might assume - so this reproduces
       that exact range instead.
    2. The response's `total_interest` (1.59) and `total_bonus` (0) fields
       matched the "Total des interets payes" / "Total des recompenses"
       figures shown on the page exactly for July 2026.

    The full response also has `opening_account`/`closing_account`,
    `opening_portfolio`/`closing_portfolio`, `total_profit_start/end`,
    `total_deposited`, `total_withdrawn`, `total_invested` (new money
    invested during the period, not a running total) and `total_principal`
    (principal repaid during the period) - checked live 2026-08-07 to see
    if any of them could fill in a backfilled past month's "total"
    (currently skip_total, unlike Monefit/Go & Grow/PeerBerry - see
    shared/report_date.py): none of them is the currently-outstanding
    invested principal per loan originator (what run()'s "total" needs).
    `closing_portfolio` looked like the best candidate but does NOT match
    even for the CURRENT still-open month (4667.86 vs the live
    sum(principal_left)/`/api/v1/dashboard`'s `total_invested` of
    2029.93) - it tracks cumulative portfolio activity, not the
    currently-outstanding balance. `closing_account` instead matches
    `/api/v1/dashboard`'s `balance_sum` (cash-side figure, not the
    invested-principal one). Loanch has no endpoint exposing "outstanding
    invested principal as of an arbitrary past date" - only the live-only
    `/api/v1/dashboard` has it for today - so "total" keeps being skipped
    for a backfilled month.

    Uses REPORT_TIMEZONE (Europe/Paris) rather than the executing machine's
    local clock to decide what "this month" means, so this stays correct
    regardless of where/when (e.g. a UTC CI runner around midnight) this
