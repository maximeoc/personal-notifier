"""Bricks (app.bricks.co) portfolio balance fetcher.

Same family as bienpreter_diversification.py / monefit_diversification.py:
Bricks is a French real-estate crowdfunding platform (immobilier), not
broken down by loan originator here - per the user's request this just
logs in and reads two figures:
  - "Investissements en cours" (currently invested capital)
  - "Solde total" (cash wallet balance = "Solde principal" + "Solde
    cadeau")
and hands total = investissements_en_cours + solde_total to
fill_current_month_amounts() - same pattern as
bienpreter_diversification.py (which similarly sums two dashboard
figures into one total), mirroring every other *_diversification.py.

REWRITTEN 2026-07-17 to use plain `requests` instead of Playwright (no
browser at all), the same technique used for
goandgrow_diversification.py. Historical context (kept for anyone reading
this later): earlier testing (2026-07-16) found that a plain non-browser
HTTP client (urllib) hitting api.bricks.co got blocked by Cloudflare (HTTP
403, "error code: 1010", Bot Fight Mode) on an OPTIONS CORS-preflight
request specifically - this led to a whole workaround (BRICKS_STORAGE_
STATE_B64: seed a Playwright storage_state exported from a real manual
login, since Playwright itself worked fine from the user's home network
but NOT from GitHub Actions' sign-in attempt, which also got "Failed to
fetch" errors matching that same Cloudflare block). Re-tested 2026-07-17
with a real Python `requests` session (not urllib, not an OPTIONS
preflight - a direct POST, which is what actually matters since browsers
only send an OPTIONS preflight for genuinely cross-origin requests, not
what a same-machine non-browser script needs to send) and it went through
cleanly: `POST api.bricks.co/api/auth/sign-in/email` returned a normal 200
with a real session cookie (`__Secure-better-auth.session_token`, 7-day
`Max-Age`), and every authenticated endpoint tested worked immediately
after. Whatever was blocking the OPTIONS preflight either doesn't apply to
a direct POST, or Cloudflare's rule has changed/relaxed since - either way,
this is now CONFIRMED working end-to-end against the real account, so the
Playwright + BRICKS_STORAGE_STATE_B64 workaround is no longer needed and
has been removed (see .github/workflows/diversification.yml). If this
platform ever gets blocked again for the plain HTTP approach too, revisit
this docstring before assuming a Playwright-based fix is the only option -
try a plain `requests` session again first, it may just work.

Auth mechanism: `POST https://api.bricks.co/api/auth/sign-in/email` with
JSON body `{"email": ..., "password": ...}` sets a
`__Secure-better-auth.session_token` cookie (a "better-auth" library
session, HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite=None) - `requests.Session()`'s cookie
jar carries it automatically on every subsequent request to
api.bricks.co, no bearer-token/header wiring needed. No session
persistence across runs is implemented (same design choice as
goandgrow_diversification.py) - logging in fresh every run is cheap and
avoids ever needing to think about cookie/session expiry.

Data sources (both real JSON APIs, found 2026-07-17 by downloading the
Expo/React-Native-Web SPA's JS bundles - `https://app.bricks.co/` links to
`/_expo/static/js/web/index-<hash>.js`, filename may change on future
redeploys, re-fetch the homepage HTML to find the current one if this
404s later - and grepping for `investor/` API path string literals):
  - `GET https://api.bricks.co/investor/portfolio/wealth/home-metrics` ->
    `{"portfolioCurrentValue": <cents>, "balanceAvailable": <cents>,
    "giftBalance": <cents>}` - this is exactly the "Patrimoine" widget's
    data (verified 2026-07-17 against the real account: portfolioCurrentValue
    = 308753 cents = 3087.53 EUR "Investissements en cours",
    balanceAvailable = 39973 cents = 399.73 EUR "Solde principal",
    giftBalance = 27 cents = 0.27 EUR "Solde cadeau" - total =
    3087.53 + 399.73 + 0.27 = 3487.53 EUR, matching the exact total
    verified via DOM-scraping in an earlier session). `solde_total` =
    balanceAvailable + giftBalance (mirrors the DOM widget's own "Solde
    total" = "Solde principal" + "Solde cadeau" breakdown).
  - `GET https://api.bricks.co/investor/portfolio/revenue?startDate=
    <yyyy-mm>&endDate=<yyyy-mm>` (MONTH granularity, unlike every other
    platform's day-level "1st of month to today" - using the current
    month for both start/end gives month-to-date) - same endpoint/shape
    already verified in earlier sessions (see fetch_current_month_revenue_totals()
    below), now just called directly via `requests` instead of through
    `page.evaluate(fetch(...))`.

Login is a real 401 (`{"message": "Invalid email or password", "code":
"INVALID_EMAIL_OR_PASSWORD"}`) on wrong credentials, not a Cloudflare
block page - handled as a normal auth failure.

IMPORTANT (2026-07-15, still applies): fill_current_month_amounts() IS
called, despite a known Sheet layout issue the user was made aware of and
chose to accept: the "Bricks" row (under the "Crowdfunding immobilier"
section) has NO blank spacer row below it like every other platform - the
very next row is "Bourse" (a different, unrelated section).
fill_current_month_amounts() always writes the platform's own row (total)
AND the row directly below it (gross_interest_received) at the
current-month column - here that second write lands on Bourse's row
instead of a spacer. The user was asked twice whether to insert a blank
row first and explicitly said not to worry about it and to just call the
Sheet function anyway - don't "fix" this by skipping the Sheet call again
without being asked.

Added 2026-09-07: Cash drag/XIRR/XIRR Bonus/XIRR Cash drag/XIRR Taxes/Frais/
XIRR Interets, mirroring the same block already built for Afranga/Swaper/
Lendermarket/PeerBerry/Loanch/Mintos/Lande - per explicit user request,
same corrections as afranga_diversification.py's 2026-09-07 backfill-month
fix (see that module's docstring), applied here from scratch. Unlike
Afranga (separate Details/Summary endpoints) or Loanch (a transaction-type
enum ledger), Bricks exposes a SINGLE unified per-transaction wallet
ledger, found via a real browser network capture (Playwright, logged in
with BRICKS_EMAIL/PASSWORD) while opening the "Mon solde" ("wallet") page:

    GET https://api.bricks.co/wallet-transactions?cursor=<offset>&take=50
    -> {"data": [{"id", "kind", "createdAt": "<ISO8601>", "status":
    confirmed/canceled/declined, "value": <cents, SIGNED for its real
    wallet-cash impact>, "giftBalanceChange": <cents>, "propertyId"/
    "propertyName": <only for property-linked kinds>, ...}], "cursor":
    <next page's cursor>, "size": 0}. `take` silently caps at 50
    server-side (2000 tested, still returned 50) - pagination is by
    `cursor` (a simple forward offset) only, newest-first, no date-range
    filter (same limitation as Loanch's transaction API) - the incremental
    cache below stops as soon as an already-cached id is seen.

    Every `kind` observed by paginating the ENTIRE account history (332
    transactions, 2025-04-16 to today) and reconciling against the live
    home-metrics API (see fetch_balances() above) - reconstructing BOTH
    the invested principal ("Investissements en cours") AND the wallet
    cash balance ("Solde total") from ONLY the confirmed rows' `value`
    field matched the live API EXACTLY (3060.34 EUR / 441.96 EUR),
    confirming the classification below is complete and correct:
      - "primary_purchase_with_refund" (confirmed only - status
        "canceled" means the purchase was refunded and net-zero, no
        separate refund transaction ever appears in the ledger) -
        INVESTMENT: value negative (wallet -> project), outstanding
        increases by -value.
      - "obligation_principal_repayment_partial"/"_final" - REPAYMENT:
        value positive (project -> wallet), outstanding decreases by
        -value (same formula as investment, just the opposite sign of
        value).
      - "topup_wire"/"topup_card" (confirmed only - "declined" card
        top-ups never reached the wallet) - EXTERNAL deposit cashflow
        for XIRR (value positive).
      - "withdrawal" - EXTERNAL withdrawal cashflow for XIRR (value
        negative).
      - "recurring_revenue" - gross interest received (gross, i.e.
        BEFORE tax - matches the existing revenue endpoint's
        obligationCoupons.untaxedTotal).
      - "withholding_tax" - tax withheld on interest (value negative,
        stored here as a positive amount, same sign convention as
        Afranga's own withholding_tax).
      - "boosted_balance_gain"/"refer_referee" - bonus/referral income
        (matches the existing revenue endpoint's boostedBalanceGain/
        referrals totals exactly).
      - Every kind above only ever affects the WALLET cash balance via
        its own `value` (no separate direction lookup needed, unlike
        Afranga's CSS-class-based direction-in/out) -
        _wallet_balance_as_of()/compute_average_idle_cash() below simply
        sum `value` for every CONFIRMED row regardless of kind.

    Because the ledger is fetched back to account inception (like
    Loanch), reconstruct_outstanding()/_wallet_balance_as_of() start
    accumulating from a true 0, and - UNLIKE every other platform in this
    repo - the reconstructed total (outstanding + wallet balance) can
    ALSO stand in for a BACKFILLED month's "total" (see run() below):
    home-metrics is a live-only endpoint with no historical equivalent,
    but since reconstructing from the ledger matches it exactly for
    today, it's used as a genuine historical total instead of Bricks'
    previous skip_total=True lock for any non-current month.

Added 2026-09-09: switched the XIRR Bonus/Cash drag/Taxes/Intérêts shares
from isolated counterfactuals (cancel ONE factor, XIRR_real - XIRR_without
that factor) to a proper Shapley-value decomposition (see
shared/xirr_shapley.py's module docstring) - the old method left an
unexplained gap between XIRR and the sum of its "explaining" shares
because XIRR is non-linear in its cashflows (interaction effects between
factors were silently dropped). Shapley shares are additive by
construction: XIRR Bonus + XIRR Cash drag + XIRR Taxes + XIRR Frais + XIRR
Intérêts now sums back to XIRR real - XIRR with every factor neutralized
(checked at runtime, warns if off by more than 0.0001). Also split the old
single "XIRR Taxes/Frais" share into "XIRR Taxes" (withholding tax) and
"XIRR Frais" - Bricks has no platform-fee concept distinct from
withholding tax (no separate fee `kind` was ever found in the wallet
ledger), so "XIRR Frais" is hardcoded to 0.0, not computed via Shapley.
Note "XIRR Cash drag" here is the LIFETIME (since-inception) share,
distinct from the plain monthly "Cash drag" row above, which is unchanged.
