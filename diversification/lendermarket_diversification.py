"""Lendermarket portfolio diversification (by loan originator) fetcher.

Logs into Lendermarket (reusing lendermarket_monitor.login(), which already
handles email/password + TOTP 2FA over pure HTTP - not duplicated here) and
fetches every active investment via the site's own "Mes investissements"
API, then groups them by loan originator ("fournisseur de crédit") and sums
the remaining principal ("capital restant") per originator. No email is
sent - the amounts are just logged and handed to fill_current_month_amounts()
(see google_sheet.py) so they can be filled into a Google Sheet, mirroring
peerberry_diversification.py.

API verified against the real account on 2026-07-09 (and re-verified via
pure HTTP on 2026-07-18):
`GET https://api.lendermarket.com/claims/v1/investor/getInvestorInvestments?activeInvestments=1&currency=EUR&page=N`
-> `{"data": [...], "meta": {"current_page", "last_page", ...}}`, one entry
per active investment:
`{"remainingPrincipal": "42.42", "lender": {"displayName": "Creditstar Sweden", ...}, "loan": {"lender": {...}, ...}, ...}`
(the top-level `lender` and `loan.lender` are the same originator, kept as a
fallback). Paginates via `meta.last_page` defensively. Requires the same
`x-xsrf-token` + `X-INVESTOR-ID` headers as every other authenticated
Lendermarket call (see lendermarket_monitor.py's module docstring for the
full auth flow).

Also fetches this calendar month's "Intérêts reçus" + "Intérêts de retard
reçus" (summed into one "interest received" figure, per explicit user
instructions) and "Primes promotionnelles et bonus" from the Account
Statement summary API - see fetch_current_month_statement_totals() below,
same idea as loanch_diversification.fetch_current_month_statement_totals()
/ swaper_diversification.fetch_current_month_interest_received() /
afranga_diversification.fetch_current_month_statement_totals() /
bienpreter_diversification.fetch_current_month_interest_totals(). Unlike
Bienpreter, Lendermarket has a clean, ready-made JSON summary endpoint for
this - no gross/net/tax reconstruction needed here.

Also computes a since-inception XIRR (money-weighted return) plus this
month's Cash drag and the XIRR Bonus / XIRR Cash drag / XIRR Taxes/Frais
pie-chart shares, mirroring afranga_diversification.py/
swaper_diversification.py's own XIRR block (see those modules' docstrings
for the full methodology) - with ONE real difference, confirmed live
2026-08-14: getInvestorAccountStatementSummary (the ONLY statement-history
endpoint Lendermarket exposes - verified live by probing a dozen
plausible per-transaction/"ledger"/"payments" endpoint names, all 404,
and by grepping the /fr/statement SPA's own loaded JS bundles for any
`/ledger|claims|payments|wallet/v*/...` path literal, none found) only
ever returns AGGREGATE totals for an arbitrary [startDate, endDate] range
(openingBalance/closingBalance/investorDepositsAmount/
investorWithdrawalsAmount/investorReceivedInterestsAmount/
investorReceivedDelayedInterestsAmount/investorBonusesAmount/
investorFeeAmount/...) - there is NO per-transaction dated ledger like
Afranga's "Details" table or Swaper's account-entries API. So instead of
real per-transaction dates, this queries the summary endpoint ONCE PER
CALENDAR MONTH since account inception (cached incrementally, see
get_cached_monthly_summaries()/lendermarket_xirr_cashflows_state.json
below) and:
  - builds ONE XIRR cashflow per month with a nonzero net
    deposit/withdrawal, dated on the 15th of that month (a deliberate
    mid-month approximation - the best available without real per-day
    dates - capped to the month's own queried end date so a still-open
    current month never gets a "future" cashflow date);
  - reconstructs "Cash drag" using each month's own (opening+closing)/2
    balance, day-weighted by how many days that month's query actually
    covered - a MONTHLY-granularity idle-cash average, not the day-by-day
    reconstruction Afranga/Swaper's Cash drag uses (their platforms expose
    a real per-transaction ledger, Lendermarket doesn't) - documented here
    as a known, deliberate approximation, not a bug;
  - sums each month's own real `investorBonusesAmount`/`investorFeeAmount`
    for the lifetime Bonus/Taxes-Frais XIRR counterfactual shares (same
    add-back-and-recompute-XIRR technique as Afranga) - `investorFeeAmount`
    is a REAL field (confirmed 0.00 on the live test account so far, same
    "genuinely zero, not a placeholder" convention as every other verified-
    but-currently-zero figure elsewhere in this repo).
The account's inception month is found via a short yearly-then-monthly
scan (see _find_first_active_year()) rather than assuming a fixed start
date, since Lendermarket accounts are typically much younger than e.g.
Swaper's - looping monthly from an arbitrarily old fixed date would waste
many empty-month API calls on the very first run.

Added 2026-08-18: XIRR Intérêts, the counterfactual XIRR share
attributable to real net interest received (mirrors
bienpreter_diversification.py's/afranga_diversification.py's/
iuvo_diversification.py's own XIRR Intérêts blocks). Lendermarket has no
separate gross/withholding-tax split on interest either (same convention
as `net_interest_received == gross_interest_received` used for `amounts`
above) - fees ("investorFeeAmount") are already isolated on their own as
"XIRR Taxes/Frais", so "lifetime net interest" here is simply the sum of
each cached month's own `interest_received` (Intérêts reçus + Intérêts de
retard reçus), with no further adjustment. This exists because "Intérêts"
was previously only ever a RESIDUAL on the spreadsheet/dashboard side
(XIRR - XIRR Bonus - XIRR Cash drag - XIRR Taxes/Frais), which can
legitimately go negative when the bonus's counterfactual XIRR share is
disproportionately large relative to the account's real underlying
(non-bonus) performance - that's not a bug, it's the correct signal that
the account's return is propped up almost entirely by the bonus. XIRR
Intérêts instead gives a genuine, independently-measured figure (same
category of computation as Bonus/Taxes, not a derived leftover), so the
two can be compared/sanity-checked against each other on the sheet/
dashboard side.

Added 2026-09-09: switched the XIRR Bonus/Cash drag/Frais/Intérêts shares
from isolated counterfactuals (cancel ONE factor, XIRR_real - XIRR_without
that factor) to a proper Shapley-value decomposition (see
shared/xirr_shapley.py's module docstring) - the old method left an
unexplained gap between XIRR and the sum of its "explaining" shares
because XIRR is non-linear in its cashflows (interaction effects between
factors were silently dropped). Shapley shares are additive by
construction: XIRR Bonus + XIRR Cash drag + XIRR Taxes + XIRR Frais + XIRR
Intérêts now sums back to XIRR real - XIRR with every factor neutralized
(checked at runtime, warns if off by more than 0.0001). Also split the old
single "XIRR Taxes/Frais" share: "investorFeeAmount" is a genuine, real
platform FEE (see above), NOT a withholding tax, so it's mapped to "XIRR
Frais" now - Lendermarket has no withholding-tax data source at all, so
"XIRR Taxes" is hardcoded to 0.0 instead.

UPDATE 2026-09-07 (implemented after all - backward reconstruction,
supersedes the "NOT IMPLEMENTED" finding below): forward-reconstructing
`total_invested` (a past active loan's remaining principal) is still
impossible for the reason below, but total_account_value at a past
`today_date` can instead be derived BACKWARD from TODAY's known live total
(`total_invested + available_balance`, always fetched live): every cached
month's own `deposits`/`withdrawals`/`interest_received`/`bonuses`/`fees`
already capture every real external cashflow/earning that occurred - so
subtracting the sum of those fields for every month AFTER `today_date`'s
own month from today's live total gives that month's real
total_account_value, with no need to ever know a past loan's principal at
all. `total_invested` at that date then falls out as a remainder (that
total minus the month's own real `closingBalance` wallet figure, already
cached). This is what now lets XIRR/Cash drag/the pie-chart shares be
computed for a backfilled month too (previously current-month-only) - see
run()'s `real_today`/`monthly_summaries_as_of` split. "total" itself (the
Crowdlending section's raw figures) still isn't written for a backfilled
month (still skip_total, unchanged).

ORIGINAL 2026-09-07 finding (still true, explains why FORWARD
reconstruction specifically doesn't work): `total_invested` is
`sum(l["remaining_principal"] for l in lenders)`, itself built from a LIVE
fetch of the account's currently-active loans (no date param exists for
that endpoint) - there is no way to know what the remaining principal on
each active loan actually WAS on some past date without a genuine
per-transaction dated ledger (which, per the whole paragraph above,
Lendermarket simply doesn't expose).
