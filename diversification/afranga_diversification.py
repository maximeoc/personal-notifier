"""Afranga portfolio diversification (by loan originator) fetcher.

Logs into afranga.com via pure HTTP (email/password + a single-field Google
Authenticator TOTP code, form-urlencoded POSTs against a Laravel CSRF `_token`
- unlike Swaper/Lendermarket/PeerBerry's JSON APIs) and fetches every active
investment from the "My investments" (https://afranga.com/profile/my-investments)
page, then groups them by loan originator and sums the outstanding
(remaining) investment amount per originator. No email is sent - the
amounts are just logged and handed to fill_current_month_amounts() (see
google_sheet.py) so they can be filled into a Google Sheet, mirroring
peerberry_diversification.py / lendermarket_diversification.py.

Auth flow verified 2026-07-18 via a real browser network capture:
  1. GET https://afranga.com/login -> parse the `_token` hidden input value
     out of the HTML form (regex only - no bs4 installed, same approach as
     bienpreter_diversification.py).
  2. POST https://afranga.com/login  form-urlencoded body
     `_token=<token>&email=<email>&password=<password>` -> 200, same URL
     (a normal Laravel form re-render, not a redirect) if 2FA is required
     next.
  3. If 2FA is enabled, parse a (possibly different) `_token` out of the
     2FA page's HTML, then POST https://afranga.com/2fa/verify
     form-urlencoded body `_token=<token>&one_time_password=<TOTP code>` ->
     200, redirects to https://afranga.com/profile/overview on success.
  4. From then on the session's cookies (a Laravel `XSRF-TOKEN` + session
     cookie pair, handled transparently by `requests.Session()`) are enough
     for every subsequent authenticated GET - no bearer token, no extra
     headers needed.

Unlike PeerBerry/Lendermarket, Afranga has no JSON API for this - "My
investments" is an old-school server-rendered (Laravel + jQuery) page: the
table is populated by
`GET https://afranga.com/profile/my-investments/refresh?<filters>&limit=N`
which returns an HTML fragment (a `<table id="myInvestmentsTable">`), not
JSON. Verified against the real account on 2026-07-09 (and re-verified via
pure HTTP on 2026-07-18):
- Requires a `_token` CSRF query param, read from `input[name='_token']` on
  the my-investments page itself (a hidden field of the filter form).
- `limit` must be one of the dropdown's allowed values (25/50/100/250) -
  250 is used here to fetch everything in one call; larger values return
  HTTP 400. No offset/page param was found, so accounts with more than 250
  active investments would be truncated (logged as a warning if the exact
  cap is hit - fine for now, revisit if/when the portfolio grows that big).
- Each `<tr>` has the loan originator as an `<img alt="X logo">` (never as
  plain text) in the 6th `<td>`, and the outstanding amount as
  "€ 1 234.56"-formatted text in the 12th `<td>` ("Outstanding Investment"
  column - the remaining/still-invested capital, as opposed to "Invested
  Amount" which is the original amount before any repayments). The last row
  is always a "Total:" summary row, not a real investment (its first `<td>`
  has no Loan ID link), and is skipped. NOTE: a leading `<td>` (a "Sell on
  Secondary market" checkbox, added by Afranga at some point after this was
  first verified) shifts every column index by +1 versus earlier versions
  of this comment - re-verify live (e.g. via a throwaway probe script) if
  investments start silently disappearing again (0 parsed rows despite a
  non-zero "Invested Funds" on the overview page is the telltale symptom).
- Parsed via regex only (no HTML parser dependency), same approach as
  bienpreter_diversification.py: split the fragment into `<tr>...</tr>`
  blocks, then each block into `<td>...</td>` cells.

Also fetches this calendar month's "Gross interest received" and
"Withholding Tax" from the Account Statement page
(https://afranga.com/profile/account-statement) - see
fetch_current_month_statement_totals() below, same idea as
swaper_diversification.fetch_current_month_interest_received() /
loanch_diversification.fetch_current_month_statement_totals().

Also fetches the account's uninvested wallet balance ("non investi" row
added 2026-08-10 under Afranga's block in "Répartition géographique") -
found live 2026-08-10 on the /profile/overview page (the same page
login() lands on): a Livewire component
`id="walletUninvestedLiveWire"` renders "€ 4.60" right next to a
"Balance:" label (also mirrored, same value, in the mobile nav menu) -
see fetch_uninvested_balance() below. Cross-checked against the same
page's "Account Balance" figure (invested total + this uninvested
balance, confirmed to match exactly: 6015.24 + 4.60 = 6019.84).

Also computes a since-inception XIRR (money-weighted return) plus this
month's Cash drag and the XIRR Bonus / XIRR Cash drag / XIRR Taxes/Frais
pie-chart shares, mirroring swaper_diversification.py's own XIRR block -
see that module's docstring for the full methodology. Afranga's own
Account Statement page's "Details" panel (fetched here via the same
`/profile/account-statement/refresh` HTML-fragment endpoint as the
"Transaction Summary" panel, just paginated with a wide date range) gives
every individual dated transaction (with a "direction-in"/"direction-out"
CSS class per row - "in" = debits the uninvested wallet, "out" = credits
it, verified 2026-08-14 against a real account: "Investments in loans"/
"Withdrawn funds" are "in", everything else - "Deposited funds", "Interest
received", "Bonus received", "Cashback bonus", "Registration Bonus",
"Interest/Principal received from early repayment" - is "out"), which
plays the same role here as Swaper's account-entries API rows: the
"Deposited funds"/"Withdrawn funds" rows become the XIRR cashflow list,
and EVERY row (any label) feeds compute_average_idle_cash()'s day-by-day
uninvested-cash reconstruction. Unlike Swaper, Afranga DOES have real
withholding tax (see fetch_statement_totals()'s "withholding_tax" field),
so taxes_xirr_contribution is genuinely computed here (not hardcoded to
0.0) via the same counterfactual-XIRR technique as Cash drag/Bonus: add
back the lifetime withholding tax to today's final value, recompute XIRR,
`taxes_xirr_contribution = xirr_real - xirr_with_taxes_cancelled` - a
NEGATIVE value (same sign convention as Cash drag: a cost already baked
into xirr_real, not a hypothetical gain).

Added 2026-08-18: XIRR Intérêts, the counterfactual XIRR share
attributable to real net interest received since inception (mirrors
bienpreter_diversification.py's own XIRR Intérêts block exactly - same
counterfactual-XIRR pattern as Bonus/Cash drag/Taxes above, just with the
lifetime net interest total - lifetime gross interest received minus
lifetime withholding tax, both already available on
`lifetime_statement_totals` here, no extra fetch needed - subtracted from
today's total account value instead of the lifetime bonus total). This
exists because "Intérêts" was previously only ever a RESIDUAL on the
spreadsheet/dashboard side (XIRR - XIRR Bonus - XIRR Cash drag - XIRR
Taxes/Frais), which can legitimately go negative when the bonus's
counterfactual XIRR share is disproportionately large relative to the
account's real underlying (non-bonus) performance - that's not a bug,
it's the correct signal that the account's return is propped up almost
entirely by the bonus. XIRR Intérêts instead gives a genuine,
independently-measured figure (same category of computation as
Bonus/Taxes, not a derived leftover), so the two can be compared/sanity-
checked against each other on the sheet/dashboard side. As with
Bienprêter, a "XIRR Intérêts" row must already exist in the Afranga block
on the sheet itself (right after "XIRR Taxes/Frais") for this new value to
land anywhere - fill_current_month_bonus_breakdown() fills an existing row
by label, it doesn't insert new labelled rows. `max_rows` is bumped
18 -> 19 to keep the search bounded past this now-taller block.

Added 2026-09-09: switched the XIRR Bonus/Cash drag/Taxes/Intérêts shares
from isolated counterfactuals (cancel ONE factor, XIRR_real - XIRR_without
that factor) to a proper Shapley-value decomposition (see
shared/xirr_shapley.py's module docstring) - the old method left an
unexplained gap between XIRR and the sum of its "explaining" shares
because XIRR is non-linear in its cashflows (interaction effects between
factors were silently dropped). Shapley shares are additive by
construction: XIRR Bonus + XIRR Cash drag + XIRR Taxes + XIRR Frais + XIRR
Intérêts now sums back to XIRR real - XIRR with every factor neutralized
(checked at runtime, warns if off by more than 0.0001). Also split the old
single "XIRR Taxes/Frais" share into "XIRR Taxes" (withholding tax only)
and "XIRR Frais" - Afranga has NO platform-fee concept distinct from
withholding tax (no such data source exists on this platform), so "XIRR
Frais" is hardcoded to 0.0 here, not computed via Shapley. Note "XIRR Cash
drag" here is the LIFETIME (since-inception) share, distinct from the
plain monthly "Cash drag" row above, which is unchanged.

       "Deposited funds" / "€ 500.00"). The "Gross interest received" row's
       label actually reads "Gross interest received (net € X.XX)" (the net
       amount is baked into the label itself) - matched here by stripping
       the "(net ...)" suffix rather than an exact string. "Withholding
       Tax" matches exactly. Confirmed against June 2026 data: Gross
       interest received = 5.51 EUR, Withholding Tax = 0.57 EUR.
    3. Rows are only rendered when non-zero (e.g. they were entirely
       absent when fetching the empty first-10-days-of-July range during
       exploration) - a missing row is treated as 0.0, not an error.
    4. Also parses "Opening balance <date>"/"Closing balance <date>" (the
       first/last summary rows, no "(net ...)" suffix to strip) - the real
       uninvested-cash balance at the start/end of the queried range,
       needed by run() for compute_average_idle_cash()'s "Cash drag"
       reconstruction (same role as Swaper's openingBalance/closingBalance
       API fields). And "Bonus received"/"Cashback bonus"/"Registration
       Bonus" (summed into "bonus_total") - queried over the account's
       full history, this gives the LIFETIME bonus total needed to isolate
       bonus_xirr_contribution the same way as
       swaper_diversification.py's referral_bonus_earned, without having
       to re-sum the (paginated) Details rows for it.

    current calendar month (1st of the month through today).

    Discovered on 2026-07-17 via a deeper nav-link crawl (going beyond the
    Account Statement page previously checked) - completely missed before:
    a dedicated "Bonus Cashback Campaigns" page (linked from the profile
    overview page), with lifetime totals ("Total Earned"/"Total Paid"/
    "Pending") plus a per-campaign history table. No JSON API backs this
    page (only marketing/analytics beacons were seen in a network capture)
    - it's server-rendered HTML, so the table itself is scraped here, same
    general approach as the Transaction Summary panel above.

    Table column layout re-verified via pure HTTP on 2026-07-18 by dumping
    the raw `<td>` cells of a real row: Campaign(0), Period(1), Bonus
    Rate(2), Investments(3), Total Invested(4), Bonus Earned(5), Bonus
    Paid(6), Payout Date(7), Action(8) - note this is one column to the
    LEFT of what the `<thead><th>` text list alone would suggest (it has a
    leading blank/icon header with no corresponding data cell), so the
    indices are hardcoded here rather than derived from the header text.

    Unlike Swaper's referral bonus page (a single lifetime total with no
    per-event date), each completed campaign here DOES have its own real
    "Payout Date" (e.g. "2025-09-24"), so a genuine "this month" figure can
    be computed by filtering on it - no lifetime-vs-monthly ambiguity here.
    Verified against the real account on 2026-07-17 (and re-verified via
    pure HTTP on 2026-07-18): only one completed campaign exists so far
    (Lendivo, paid out 2025-09-24, 5.00 EUR), so this month's total is
    correctly 0.00 - a real computed result, not a hardcoded assumption.

    bound that drift risk to just THIS period's own events instead of the

    - `invested_closing_anchor`: the real LIVE total outstanding as of
      `end_date` (fetch_investments()'s own sum, unrelated to the Details

      historical equivalent for a past month's invested total). The
      period's own invested events are replayed BACKWARDS from it (opening
      = anchor - net change over the period), so the period's last day is
      always exactly right and only the days before it depend on this
      period's own (much smaller) classification risk.
    - `non_invested_opening_anchor`: the real wallet balance as of
      `start_date` (Account Statement's own "Opening balance" row, same
      value compute_average_idle_cash() anchors "Cash drag" on) - this
      figure IS available for a REPORT_DATE-backfilled past month too (the
      Account Statement endpoint accepts any date range), so callers
      should normally always pass this one. The period's own cash events
      are then replayed FORWARDS from it, exactly like

    # withholding tax on gross interest, same as Bienprêter's equivalent row.
    # "XIRR"/"Cash drag" and the XIRR Bonus/Cash drag/Taxes-Frais/Intérêts
    # pie-chart shares sit further down the block - only included when
    # actually computed. The search below the platform's row is bounded
    # dynamically (stops at the next platform's own row), no more
    # hardcoded `max_rows` to bump whenever a row is inserted. IMPORTANT: a
    # "XIRR Intérêts" row must exist in
    # the Afranga block on the sheet itself (right after "XIRR
    # Taxes/Frais") for this new value to actually land somewhere - this
    # script fills an existing row by label, it doesn't insert new
    # labelled rows into this block. Since 2026-09-09, "XIRR Taxes"/
    # "XIRR Frais" replace the old single "XIRR Taxes/Frais" key -
    # "XIRR Taxes" still substring-matches an existing "XIRR Taxes/Frais"
    # Sheet cell (find_rows_by_texts_below is a case-insensitive substring
    # match), so no Sheet edit is required for it; "XIRR Frais" needs its
    # own new row to actually be written anywhere (Afranga's is always
    # 0.0 anyway - no platform-fee concept distinct from withholding tax
    # exists here, so no row is needed for this platform specifically).
