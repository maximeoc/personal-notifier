"""Income Marketplace (getincome.com) portfolio diversification fetcher.

Income Marketplace is a Vue SPA (frontend at getincome.com) on top of a
pure JSON REST API (api.getincome.com), using Auth0 for authentication.
Reverse-engineered live 2026-09-08 via a real login + Playwright network
capture (see repo memory for the full exploration).

Auth flow:
    1. POST https://api.getincome.com/api/auth0-login
       JSON body {"username": <email>, "password": <password>}
       -> {"success": false, "mfa_required": true, "mfa_token": <opaque
           Iron-sealed string>} (2FA is always enabled on the observed
       test account).
    2. POST https://api.getincome.com/api/auth0-login-mfa
       JSON body {"mfa_token": <from step 1>, "otp": <6-digit TOTP code>}
       -> the real access/refresh tokens (delivered to the SPA, which
       stores them in `localStorage["accessToken"]`/`["refreshToken"]` -
       the accessToken is a ~24h JWT, sent as `Authorization: Bearer
       <accessToken>` on every subsequent call).
    Added 2026-09-11: `login()` now reuses a persisted session first
    (accessToken restored into localStorage via Playwright's own
    storage_state mechanism, `STORAGE_STATE_FILE`) - a real 2FA login is
    only performed when there's no persisted token or it's stopped working
    (the ~24h JWT expired). A fresh login on EVERY month of a month-range
    backfill was found to trigger Income Marketplace's own anti-abuse
    rate-limiting (2 separate months' logins rejected outright, see repo
    memory) - reusing the session across the whole backfill (and across
    scheduled runs, since the state file is cache-persisted in CI too)
    avoids repeating a real TOTP submission unless truly necessary.
    A DIRECT plain `requests` replay of step 1 (no browser at all) was
    tried and got an HTTP 503 - but the response body was Michelin's own
    "Security threat detected" corporate-proxy block page, NOT a real
    getincome.com response (confirmed by the page title/HTML) - i.e. this
    is the same LOCAL-ONLY corporate-proxy gotcha already documented
    elsewhere in this repo for POST-to-a-login-path requests, not proof
    that the real server blocks pure HTTP. Since this couldn't be
    conclusively re-tested from a non-Michelin network, this module stays
    Playwright-based for BOTH login and every data call (via
    `page.evaluate(fetch(...))`, reusing the same `Authorization: Bearer`
    header read from localStorage) rather than risk an unverified plain
    `requests.Session()` architecture - same safety-first precedent as
    Swaper's permanently-Playwright-based design elsewhere in this repo.

Data endpoints (all under api.getincome.com, `Authorization: Bearer` auth):
    - GET /api/investor-details -> `funds` (available=uninvested cash,
      invested=current outstanding total, total=available+invested),
      `earnings` (`interest`=lifetime gross interest), `marketplace_earned`
      (`all_time`/`ytd`/`mtd`=month-to-date, matches the account-statement
      "Interest collected" turnover for the current month exactly),
      `charts.division.by_loan_originator` = [{"loan_originator": <name>,
      "total_sum": <current outstanding EUR>}] - the exact per-lending-
      company breakdown needed for "Répartition géographique" (same
      "group by loan originator" convention as Swaper/Nectaro/Iuvo in this
      repo, despite the Sheet section being named "géographique").
    - GET /api/account-statement/{start:YYYY-MM-DD}/{end:YYYY-MM-DD}/{page}
      -> `{"opening_balance", "closing_balance", "invested_start_balance",
      "invested_balance", "statement": [{"account_type": <numeric id str>,
      "account_type_name": <label>, "opening_balance", "closing_balance",
      "turnover2": <sum for the period>, "turnover": [{"Date"
      (YYYY-MM-DD), "Amount", "transaction_id", "lo_name", ...}]}]}` - this
      ALWAYS returns every category (no "type" filter to omit - there
      isn't one on this endpoint at all), directly satisfying the user's
      "prends en compte tous les types de transactions" request with no
      extra code needed. Verified live (full lifetime history, brand-new
      test account created 2026-08-25) - only 7 categories exist:
      2199021 "Deposits made" (cash IN, not invested), 2199022 "Principal
      collected" (cash IN, invested DECREASE), 2199023 "Interest collected"
      (cash IN, not invested - the gross interest figure), 2199024 "Bonus
      collected" (cash IN, not invested - the bonus/cashback figure),
      2199025 "Investments made" (cash OUT - `Amount` is ALREADY negative
      in the raw data, invested INCREASE), 2199026 "Withdrawals" (cash OUT
      - never observed live yet, ASSUMED negative like "Investments made"
      to match every other observed category's sign convention - if a
      real withdrawal ever shows a POSITIVE `Amount` instead, the
      reconstructed closing-balance cross-check below will flag a
      mismatch), 2199027 "Principal collected by enforced buyback
      obligation" (never observed live yet, treated identically to
      "Principal collected" by its name). NO withholding-tax category
      exists at all - `withholding_tax` is hardcoded 0.0 (a genuinely
      verified absence, not a placeholder - re-check with a wider date
      dump if a future run's diagnostics ever show tax being withheld).
      PAGINATION GOTCHA (found live 2026-09-08): the trailing `{page}`
      path segment does NOT paginate safely past page 0 - requesting page
      1 returns a PDF blob (`%PDF-1.4...`) instead of a JSON "empty next
      page", crashing a naive fetch/JSON-parse. Since this account is
      small (a handful of dozens of rows per category over its whole
      lifetime, confirmed live), this module only ever requests page 0 -
      see `fetch_all_statement_transactions()`'s own docstring for the
      (best-effort, not foolproof) large-row-count warning tripwire.
      IMPORTANT GOTCHA (same class of bug as Afranga's/Debitum's own
      documented lesson): the same `transaction_id` is reused across
      MULTIPLE distinct rows for one real underlying event (e.g. a single
      loan repayment splits into a "Principal collected" row AND an
      "Interest collected" row sharing one `transaction_id`) - the
      incremental cache below dedupes on (account_type, transaction_id,
      date, amount), never `transaction_id` alone.

Since-inception XIRR/Cash drag block (mirrors nectaro_diversification.py's
design almost exactly, including using the SAME shared
`shared.weighted_average.compute_time_weighted_average()` helper for
"solde moyen pondéré investi"/"non investi"): also supports a
REPORT_DATE-backfilled past month - the account value at that date is the
live balances minus every cash/invested movement after it (see run()).

Added 2026-09-09: switched the XIRR Bonus/Cash drag/Intérêts shares from
isolated counterfactuals (cancel ONE factor, XIRR_real - XIRR_without that
factor) to a proper Shapley-value decomposition (see
shared/xirr_shapley.py's module docstring) - the old method left an
unexplained gap between XIRR and the sum of its "explaining" shares
because XIRR is non-linear in its cashflows (interaction effects between
factors were silently dropped). Shapley shares are additive by
construction: XIRR Bonus + XIRR Cash drag + XIRR Intérêts now sums back to
XIRR real - XIRR with every factor neutralized (checked at runtime, warns
if off by more than 0.0001). Also split the old single "XIRR Taxes/Frais"
share into "XIRR Taxes" and "XIRR Frais" - Income Marketplace has NEITHER
a withholding-tax category NOR a distinct platform-fee category anywhere
in its account-statement API, so BOTH are hardcoded to 0.0, not computed
via Shapley (neither is part of the game).
