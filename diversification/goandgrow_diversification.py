"""Go & Grow (Bondora's savings product, https://app.goandgrow.eu/en/gogrow)
balance and statement fetcher.

Same overall data flow/Sheet-writing conventions as monefit_diversification.py
("Crowdlending savings" is a single savings product, no per-loan-originator
split), but a fundamentally different LOGIN TECHNIQUE: Go & Grow's Cloudflare
bot-management blocks Playwright/CDP-driven navigation unconditionally (every
request gets an empty `content-length: 0` response), even with a valid,
authenticated session cookie already seeded into a fresh context - confirmed
reproducible across the bundled Chromium, `channel="chrome"` and
`channel="msedge"`. A plain, non-CDP HTTP client (Python's `requests`) is NOT
blocked at all - neither for the initial GET nor for the POST/form-submission
login requests - so this script logs in via a pure-HTTP replay of the site's
Keycloak/OIDC login flow instead of using Playwright, which also happens to
satisfy running unattended in GitHub Actions trivially (no browser/Chromium
install needed at all, just `requests`).

Login flow (Keycloak/OIDC, `response_mode=form_post`), verified end-to-end
against the real account on 2026-07-17:
    1. `GET https://app.goandgrow.eu/en/gogrow` redirects (via
       `sso.bondora.com`) to a real Keycloak login page with a `<form>`
       whose `action` URL and hidden inputs (`session_code`, `execution`,
       `client_id`, `tab_id`, `client_data`, `credentialId`, ...) must be
       replayed verbatim - only `username`/`password` need to be filled in.
    2. POSTing that form returns a page containing a SECOND hidden
       auto-submit `<form>` (OIDC callback: `code`, `iss`, `id_token`,
       `state`, `session_state`, `continue`) targeting
       `https://app.goandgrow.eu/signin-oidc`.
    3. POSTing THAT form lands on the real, authenticated dashboard HTML
       with a full session cookie jar (`AppAuthCookie`, `accessToken`,
       `bsid`, Keycloak session cookies, etc.) - no JS execution needed
       anywhere in this exchange.
No 2FA/TOTP step was observed on this account.

The dashboard/statements HTML pages are just an SPA shell (data is rendered
client-side by a React app loaded via an iframe) with no server-rendered
balance/statement figures - the real data comes from a separate JSON API
discovered by grepping that SPA's JS bundle for the string "api.prd.goandgrow":
    - `GET https://api.prd.goandgrow.eu/investor/api/v2/gogrow` -> a JSON
      array of "goals" (this account currently has exactly one, named
      "Go & Grow" itself, since no custom sub-goal was created), each with
      `ClientValue` (current balance), `TotalDeposits`, `TotalEarnings`,
      `AnnualTargetReturnRate`.
    - `GET https://api.prd.goandgrow.eu/investor/api/v2/statements` -> a
      JSON array of ledger entries: `{"Type": "Deposit"|"Return"|..., ...,
      "Amount": <float>, "Date": <ISO datetime>, "Balance": <float>}`.
      "Return" entries are Go & Grow's daily interest accrual ("Go & Grow
      returns"); "Deposit" AND any "Withdraw"/"Withdrawal"-labelled entry
      (matched case-insensitively by substring, e.g. found live 2026-08-14
      on a real withdrawal) are capital movements, not income - both are
      excluded from every bucket below. IMPORTANT: confirmed 2026-08-14
      there is NO separate "fee"-labelled Type/entry for the flat 1 EUR
      fee Go & Grow charges on every withdrawal - it's silently deducted,
      never itemized in the statement - so "fees" is instead INFERRED as
      `(number of Withdraw*-Type entries this month) * WITHDRAWAL_FEE_EUR`
      and written to the Sheet's "frais" sub-row. No bonus/cashback/
      contest-labelled entry TYPE has been observed yet on this account -
      any entry whose Type is neither Deposit/Return nor Withdraw* is
      treated as bonus/cashback/contest income by default (see
      fetch_current_month_statement_totals() below), so a real one will be
      picked up automatically once it occurs; its exact Type label should
      be double-checked against the log output at that point.
    Both endpoints accept the plain `requests.Session()`'s cookies with no
    extra bearer-token/CORS workaround needed (same as most other
    *_diversification.py's directly-called JSON APIs).

Added 2026-09-09: switched the XIRR Bonus/Frais/Intérêts shares from
isolated counterfactuals (cancel ONE factor, XIRR_real - XIRR_without that
factor) to a proper Shapley-value decomposition (see
shared/xirr_shapley.py's module docstring) - the old method left an
unexplained gap between XIRR and the sum of its "explaining" shares
because XIRR is non-linear in its cashflows (interaction effects between
factors were silently dropped). Shapley shares are additive by
construction: XIRR Bonus + XIRR Frais + XIRR Intérêts now sums back to
XIRR real - XIRR with every factor neutralized (Cash drag/Taxes are
always exactly 0.0 on this platform, see below, so they don't need to be
part of the game - checked at runtime, warns if off by more than 0.0001).
IMPORTANT sign-flip vs every other platform: Go & Grow has NO withholding
tax at all (statements API has no tax breakdown), so "XIRR Taxes" is
hardcoded to 0.0 - but it DOES have a real, distinct platform fee (the
flat withdrawal fee above), so "XIRR Frais" is the one genuinely computed
via Shapley here (the OLD code mislabelled this exact same fee-based
counterfactual as "taxes_xirr_contribution"/"XIRR Taxes/Frais" - now
correctly attributed to Frais only).

Required env vars:
    GOANDGROW_EMAIL, GOANDGROW_PASSWORD  -> Go & Grow account credentials
                                             (falls back to the legacy
                                             GOANDGROW_EMAIL/GOANDGROW_PASSWORD
                                             names if the new ones aren't set)
Optional:
    GOOGLE_SHEET_ID, GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS   -> used to write this month's totals
                                              to the Google Sheet via
                                              fill_current_month_amounts() /
                                              fill_current_month_bonus_breakdown()
                                              (see shared/google_sheet.py)

Added 2026-09-11: DOES now persist the session (cookies) across runs via
`SESSION_STATE_FILE`/`shared.session_cache` - avoids a fresh login for
every month of a `run_diversification_for_month_range.sh` backfill, only
logging in again if the persisted session stops working.
