"""Bienpreter dashboard balance fetcher.

Same family as afranga_diversification.py / monefit_diversification.py etc,
but simpler and different in one key way: Bienpreter is NOT broken down by
loan originator at all here - per the user's request, this just logs into
https://www.bienpreter.com, reads two figures on the dashboard
(https://www.bienpreter.com/u/tableau-de-bord):
  - "solde disponible" (available cash balance not yet invested)
  - "capital à recevoir" (capital still to be repaid on active investments)
sums them, and hands the single total to fill_current_month_amounts() (see
google_sheet.py) - no per-originator dict, just one number, no email sent
either.

ADDED 2026-07-31: unlike the "Crowdlending" section above (single aggregate
figure), the "Répartition géographique" section's Bienprêter block IS
broken down - one row per BORROWER (emprunteur, e.g. "EXCAVAN"), with a
country-column matrix (one column per country, shared across every
platform's block on that sheet). `fetch_active_loans_by_borrower()` fetches
every currently active ("en cours") loan from
https://www.bienpreter.com/u/mes-prets (paginated), sums the invested
amount per borrower (a borrower can have several concurrent loans/
contracts), and resolves each loan's country via its project page
(https://www.bienpreter.com/projets/{id}, "Localisation" field, e.g.
"Madrid - Espagne" -> "Espagne" - see _country_from_location() for the
French-domestic-postal-code special case). The result feeds
shared.google_sheet.fill_bienpreter_borrower_geo_amounts(), which writes
each borrower's amount into the matching country column, inserts a new row
for any borrower not already listed (right after the block's last existing
borrower - explicitly re-styled to match sibling borrower rows, since an
inserted row inherits the next platform header's bold/left-aligned style
otherwise), DELETES any row whose borrower no longer has an active loan,
and rewrites every remaining row's "total" column (one column right of the
borrower name) as a live "=SOMME(...)" formula summing that row's country
columns - it deliberately never touches the "Bienprêter" row's OWN total
column (kept manual, per explicit user request).

REWRITTEN 2026-07-17 to use plain `requests` instead of Playwright (no
browser at all), same technique as bricks_diversification.py /
goandgrow_diversification.py - much faster in GitHub Actions (no Chromium
download/launch). Verified live: Bienpreter is a plain Symfony
(server-rendered) site with NO Cloudflare/bot-protection at all on the
login form or the dashboard/operations pages - a vanilla `requests.Session()`
sails through with zero issues, no cookie-seeding/storage_state workaround
needed like Bricks briefly required.

Login mechanism (Symfony CSRF-protected form, verified 2026-07-17):
`GET https://www.bienpreter.com/connexion` returns an HTML form (name=
"user_login", method="post", NO `action` attribute - posts back to the same
`/connexion` URL) with hidden inputs `_csrf_token` and `user_login[_token]`
(both must be read fresh from that GET and POSTed back verbatim - they're
per-session/per-request Symfony CSRF tokens, not static). POST fields:
`user_login[email]`, `user_login[password]`, `user_login[remember_me]=1`,
plus the two token fields above. A successful login response is a 200
whose final URL (`requests` follows the redirect chain automatically) is
`/u/tableau-de-bord` - the dashboard IS the login response body itself (no
extra navigation needed), so `fetch_balances()` just parses that same
response's HTML directly instead of a second GET. No 2FA/TOTP step exists
on this account (confirmed in the original 2026-07-09 Playwright build
too).

The dashboard's markup was inspected end-to-end against the real account,
so `fetch_balances()` uses precise regex patterns (mirroring the original
Playwright DOM-scraping selectors) rather than a generic heuristic:
- "Capital à recevoir" is a proper `<dl><dt>Capital à recevoir</dt><dd
  class="...">1 220,00 €</dd></dl>` pair - found via a regex anchored on
  the `<dt>` text containing "recevoir", value from the following `<dd>`.
- "Solde disponible" is a `<div class="useroffice-box"><p>Solde
  disponible<br><span class="number big">955,25 €</span></p>...</div>`
  block - found via a regex anchored on the `<p>` text starting with
  "Solde disponible", value from the nested `<span>`.
  Note: this exact balance value also appears elsewhere on the page with
  no nearby label (top nav "Solde : ...", a bare `<span class="number
  big">`) - a generic "scan every currency-looking string and guess by
  nearby keyword" approach does NOT work reliably here (the account-
  summary panel groups several different labeled values - Capital,
  Capital remboursé, Capital à recevoir, Intérêts bruts/nets... - inside
  one shared container, so several candidates' surrounding text
  legitimately contains unrelated keywords). Hence the precise anchored
  regexes above instead.

Also fetches this calendar month's interest received (like every other
*_diversification.py's equivalent) from the "Toutes mes opérations" page
(https://www.bienpreter.com/u/operations) - see
fetch_current_month_interest_totals() below for exactly how gross/net/
withholding tax are obtained (Bienpreter has no single labeled "net
interest" figure anywhere, so this is reconstructed from NET = GROSS - TAX
using two real figures read off the page, not a guessed/configured flat
tax rate). Verified this page is ALSO plain server-rendered HTML reachable
via a normal `session.get(...)` with the same date-range/page query params
used in the original Playwright build - same row markup
(`.transaction__name`/`.transaction__amount`/`.transaction__interests`),
same "one placeholder row on out-of-range pages" pagination quirk. Also
sums a real "Bonus" row type (confirmed live 2026-08-14 - a genuine
transaction label, not a placeholder) into `bonus_total`, replacing the
old hardcoded 0.0 placeholder that predated this discovery.

Added 2026-08-14: since-inception XIRR (money-weighted return) plus this
month's Cash drag and the XIRR Bonus / XIRR Cash drag / XIRR Taxes/Frais
pie-chart shares, mirroring swaper_diversification.py's/
afranga_diversification.py's own XIRR blocks (see those modules'
docstrings for the full methodology) - see fetch_all_operations()/
get_cached_operations()/compute_average_idle_cash() below. IMPORTANT
DIFFERENCE from Swaper/Afranga: Bienpreter's own operations table already
carries a real per-row "Solde indicatif" running balance right after
every transaction (`.transaction__balance`, verified live to match the
dashboard's own "Solde disponible" exactly for the most recent row) - so
Cash drag's day-by-day idle-cash reconstruction here just REPLAYS those
real balance snapshots instead of reconstructing a running total from
signed per-type deltas the way Swaper/Afranga have to (neither of those
platforms expose a real per-transaction balance). Every operation type's
amount here is ALSO already signed correctly by the site itself (deposits
positive, investments/withdrawals/withholding tax negative, etc. -
verified live across all 10 distinct transaction types this account has
ever had) - no direction-class/type-to-sign mapping needed either, unlike
Afranga's Details table. "Dépôt de fonds"/"Retrait de fonds" are the only
real EXTERNAL cashflows (XIRR); "Vente de prêt" (loan resold on the
secondary market) and "Rétractation de l'intention de prêt" (a loan
commitment reversed) are internal reallocations, same treatment as
Swaper's INVESTMENT/REPAYMENT/BUYBACK types - never treated as XIRR
cashflows, but DO count for the day-by-day balance replay (their real
"Solde indicatif" is used as-is).

Added 2026-08-18: XIRR Intérêts, the counterfactual XIRR share
attributable to real net interest received (mirrors XIRR Bonus's own
counterfactual pattern exactly, just with the lifetime net interest total
- gross interest received minus withholding tax, both already reconstructed
from real /u/operations rows - subtracted from today's total account value
instead of the lifetime bonus total). This exists because "Intérêts" was
previously only ever a RESIDUAL on the spreadsheet/dashboard side (XIRR -
XIRR Bonus - XIRR Cash drag - XIRR Taxes/Frais), which can legitimately go
negative when the bonus's counterfactual XIRR share is disproportionately
large relative to the account's real underlying (non-bonus) performance -
that's not a bug, it's the correct signal that the account's return is
propped up almost entirely by the bonus. XIRR Intérêts instead gives a
genuine, independently-measured figure (same category of computation as
Bonus/Taxes, not a derived leftover), so the two can be compared/sanity-
checked against each other on the sheet/dashboard side.

UPDATE 2026-10-06: the backward reconstruction below is NO LONGER used by
run() - it propagated every later loss/drift (e.g. loans sold at a
discount) into past months and gave absurd XIRRs (330769% for 2025-04).
A backfilled month's total_account_value is now rebuilt FORWARD from
inception via _total_account_value_delta_for_row() (same as
compute_average_balances()). The lifetime XIRR waterfall shares also no
longer depend on the previous month having a balance (first-month accounts).

UPDATE 2026-09-07 (implemented via backward reconstruction, resolving the
limitation noted below): forward-reconstructing "capital à recevoir" for
an arbitrary past date is still impossible (see the unchanged paragraph
below for why), but total_account_value at a past `today_date` can
instead be derived BACKWARD from TODAY's known live total (solde
disponible + capital à recevoir, always fetched live regardless of
REPORT_DATE): every transaction dated after `today_date` is either a pure
cash<->invested-capital reallocation (Investissement, Remboursement
mensuel's bundled capital portion, Vente de prêt, Rétractation de
l'intention de prêt - net zero effect on the SUM of the two components)
or a real external cashflow/earnings event (Dépôt de fonds, Retrait de
fonds, Intérêts, Bonus, Prélèvements fiscaux) whose effect on that sum IS
known precisely - so subtracting only the latter's net effect (see
`_net_value_change()`) from today's live total gives today_date's real
total_account_value, with no need to ever itemize a matured loan's
principal at all. "Capital à recevoir" at today_date then falls out as a
remainder: total_account_value minus the real replayed "Solde indicatif"
cash balance as of that date (`_balance_as_of()`, same snapshot-replay
technique as compute_average_idle_cash()). This is what now lets XIRR/
Cash drag/the pie-chart shares be computed for a backfilled month too
(previously current-month-only, gated behind `is_current_month()`) - see
run()'s `real_today`/`today_date` split below. "total" itself (the
Crowdlending section's raw solde disponible + capital à recevoir figures)
still isn't written for a backfilled month (still skip_total, unchanged) -
only the derived XIRR/Cash drag block benefits from this reconstruction.

ORIGINAL 2026-09-07 FINDING (still true, explains why forward
reconstruction specifically doesn't work): unlike Afranga (whose Details
rows have an explicit "Investments in loans"/"Principal ..." label per
row, letting `reconstruct_outstanding()` replay the invested-principal
balance for any past date), Bienpreter's "capital à recevoir" CANNOT be
reliably reconstructed FORWARD from zero using /u/operations rows for an
arbitrary past date: "Remboursement mensuel" rows only itemize the
INTEREST portion (`.transaction__interests`) - any bundled CAPITAL
repayment (when a loan matures within the queried window) is silently
folded into that same row's `.transaction__amount` with no separate
principal figure anywhere (see this module's own "In Fine loans"
docstring paragraph above).

Added 2026-09-09: switched the XIRR Bonus/Cash drag/Taxes/Intérêts shares
from isolated counterfactuals (cancel ONE factor, XIRR_real - XIRR_without
that factor) to a proper Shapley-value decomposition (see
shared/xirr_shapley.py's module docstring) - the old method left an
unexplained gap between XIRR and the sum of its "explaining" shares
because XIRR is non-linear in its cashflows (interaction effects between
factors were silently dropped). Shapley shares are additive by
construction: XIRR Bonus + XIRR Cash drag + XIRR Taxes + XIRR Frais + XIRR
Intérêts now sums back to XIRR real - XIRR with every factor neutralized
(checked at runtime, warns if off by more than 0.0001). Also split the old
single "XIRR Taxes/Frais" share into "XIRR Taxes" (withholding tax, i.e.
"Prélèvements fiscaux") and "XIRR Frais" - Bienprêter has NO platform-fee
concept distinct from withholding tax (no such operation type was ever
observed on this account), so "XIRR Frais" is hardcoded to 0.0, not
computed via Shapley. Note "XIRR Cash drag" here is the LIFETIME (since-
inception) share, distinct from the plain monthly "Cash drag" row above,
which is unchanged.

    'City - Country' (e.g. 'Madrid - Espagne', 'Bucarest - Roumanie',
    even 'Montpellier - France'), domestic (French) ones instead start
    with a postal code and have NO country at all - either just
    '13007 Marseille'/'92800 PUTEAUX', OR (confusingly) STILL a dash

    it's always France regardless of any dash; otherwise take the text
    after the last ' - ' if present.

    BUG FIXED 2026-09-08: a THIRD domestic format also exists - some French
    project pages render ONLY the bare city name, with NEITHER a postal
    code NOR a dash at all (confirmed live: 'Saint-Philbert-de-Grand-Lieu',
    'Rivière-Salée' - both real French communes, project ids 5472/5473,
    borrower 'BEMA'). The OLD code returned this bare string as-is (treated
    as if it were itself a "country" name), which never matches any real
    country column header - the amount was then silently dropped from the
    Répartition géographique write ("pays introuvable" issue), causing a
    real, reproduced 250 EUR gap between the live 'capital à recevoir'
    total (5320 EUR) and the sum of the Bienprêter geo block's borrower
    rows (5070 EUR). Every FOREIGN project observed so far always includes
    an explicit ' - <Country>' suffix, so a bare city name with no dash and
    no leading digits is assumed to be French domestic too, not a country
    name on its own - logged as a warning (not silently guessed) since this
    is a real assumption, not a proven rule, in case a future foreign
    project ever omits its country suffix too.
