"""Nectaro portfolio diversification (by lending company) fetcher.

Nectaro (nectaro.eu) is a Dyninno-group crowdlending platform, built as a
Nuxt.js (Vue) single-page app on top of a pure JSON REST API
(api.nectaro.eu, Symfony backend). Unlike most other platforms in this
repo, login/2FA/data are ALL plain HTTP JSON calls - no Playwright/browser
needed at all (same category as Go & Grow/Bricks/Iuvo).

Auth flow (reverse-engineered 2026-09-08 via a real login + Playwright
network capture, then independently verified with a plain
`requests.Session()` - see repo memory for the full exploration):
  1. POST https://api.nectaro.eu/api/login
     JSON body `{"username": <email>, "password": <password>}` (NOT
     "email" - a bare `{"email":...}` body gets rejected with a generic
     "This value should be of type string." validation error, since the
     API only recognizes the "username" field name).
     -> `{"token": <jwt>|null, "refresh_token": <str>|null,
          "temporary_token": <jwt>|null, "twoFactorAuthRequired": bool}`.
     If `token` is already set, 2FA is not required this time (not
     observed on the real test account, which always has 2FA enabled -
     handled defensively below anyway).
  2. If `twoFactorAuthRequired`, POST
     https://api.nectaro.eu/api/two-factor/verify
     JSON body `{"code": <6-digit TOTP>, "temporaryToken": <temporary_token
     from step 1>}` -> `{"token": <jwt>, "refresh_token": <str>}`.
  3. Every subsequent authenticated call sends `Authorization: Bearer
     <token>` (a JWT, ~45 min lifetime - a single run finishes in seconds,
     no refresh-token handling needed).

Data endpoints (all under api.nectaro.eu, `Authorization: Bearer` auth):
  - `GET /api/customer/me` -> `cashAccountBalance` (uninvested wallet,
    "non investi"), `portfolioAmount` (current invested/outstanding total,
    matches `investedFunds` below).
  - `GET /api/investment/dashboard` -> `investedFunds`/`currentBalance`
    (LIVE snapshot totals, same two figures as customer/me).
  - `GET /api/dashboard/investment?isHistorical=false&grouping=loan-originator`
    -> `[{"id": <product id>, "totalAmount", "totalResidueAmount"}, ...]` -
    `totalResidueAmount` is the CURRENT outstanding (residue) amount per
    product id, used for the "Répartition géographique" breakdown.
  - `GET /api/products` -> `{<product id>: {"entity": {"loanOriginator":
    {"legalName": ...}, ...}}}` - maps each product id above to its real
    lending company name (`legalName`, e.g. `SIA "Abele Finance"`) -
    confirmed to match the `lendingCompany` field on individual loans in
    the portfolio listing below exactly.
  - `POST /api/investment/portfolio` body `{"meta": [{"limit": N, "page":
    P}], "filters": []}` -> paginated list of individual loans (ID, ISIN,
    amount, interestRate, lendingCompany, borrowerCountry, status, ...) -
    NOT used for the geographic breakdown itself (the grouping endpoint
    above is simpler/already residue-based), kept available for reference
    only.
  - `POST /api/statement/list` body `{"meta": [{"limit": N, "page": P}],
    "filters": [{"name": "type", "values": [], "type": "multiselect"},
    {"name": "dateFrom", "value": "YYYY-MM-DD", "type": "datepicker"},
    {"name": "dateUntil", "value": "YYYY-MM-DD", "type": "datepicker"}]}
    -> `{"statement": {"openingBalance", "closingBalance", "incomingSum",
    "outgoingSum"}, "transactions": [{"date": "DD Mon YYYY HH:MM", "type":
    ..., "direction": "IN"|"OUT", "details", "amount", "status", "id"}]}`.
    An EMPTY `values` array on the "type" filter means "no type filter -
    every transaction type included" (confirmed live: identical result
    with vs. without a "type" filter present at all) - per explicit user
    request ("regarde dans le filtre tout les transactions type pour tous
    les prendre en compte"), the "type" filter is deliberately OMITTED
    entirely here so every real type is always included, forward-
    compatible with any new type Nectaro might add later without needing
    a code change. Real types confirmed live on the test account:
    DEPOSIT, WITHDRAWAL (not observed yet, forward-looking), INVESTMENT,
    PRINCIPAL, INTEREST, TAXATION (tax on interest), REWARD (bonus, gross),
    REWARD_TAXATION (tax on a REWARD, ~5%; a separate type, confirmed live
    2026-10-02).
    `direction` is a clean, generic "IN credits the cash wallet, OUT
    debits it" scheme (confirmed against every observed type) - much
    simpler than Afranga's CSS-class-based direction-in/direction-out
    convention, used directly for the day-by-day idle-cash/invested-
    balance reconstruction below instead of a type->sign lookup table.

Since-inception XIRR/Cash drag block (mirrors afranga_diversification.py's
ORIGINAL design, i.e. before its 2026-09-07 backward-reconstruction-for-
backfill enhancement - see that module's docstring/repo memory for the
full methodology this is based on): now also supports a REPORT_DATE-
backfilled past month - the account value at that date is the live
balances minus every cash/invested movement after it (see run()).
  - XIRR cashflows: every DEPOSIT (negative, money invested) and WITHDRAWAL
    (positive, money returned) transaction, since account inception,
    fetched incrementally via `nectaro_xirr_cashflows_state.json` (deduped
    by Nectaro's own transaction "id" field - confirmed to be a real,
    stable, per-row unique integer, unlike Afranga's reused transaction_id
    that needed a composite dedup key).
  - Terminal cashflow: today's real `investedFunds + cashAccountBalance`.
  - Cash drag / XIRR Cash drag / XIRR Bonus / XIRR Taxes / XIRR Frais /
    XIRR Intérêts: XIRR Bonus/Cash drag/Taxes/Intérêts use a Shapley-value
    decomposition (see shared/xirr_shapley.py, added 2026-09-09) instead
    of isolated counterfactuals, so the shares sum back to the real XIRR
    gap exactly. Nectaro's "TAXATION" transaction type is a genuine
    withholding tax, kept under "XIRR Taxes"; no distinct fee concept
    exists on this platform, so "XIRR Frais" is hardcoded 0.0. Cash drag's
    own avg-idle-cash input computed via the existing generic
    `shared.weighted_average.compute_time_weighted_average()` (a plain
    day-weighted average of a running balance) instead of a bespoke
    per-platform reconstruction function - Nectaro's clean IN/OUT
    direction field makes this a direct drop-in.
  - "solde moyen pondéré investi"/"non investi" rows use the same utility,
    fed by INVESTMENT (direction OUT, +invested)/PRINCIPAL (direction IN,
    -invested) for the invested-balance series and every transaction's own
    IN/OUT delta for the cash-balance series.

Required environment variables:
    NECTARO_EMAIL, NECTARO_PASSWORD -> login credentials.
    NECTARO_TOTP_SECRET             -> base32 TOTP secret (2FA is always
                                       enabled on the observed test
                                       account).
    GOOGLE_SHEET_ID, GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS -> used to write this month's
                                       totals to the Google Sheet, same
                                       convention as every other
                                       *_diversification.py.
