"""PeerBerry portfolio "distribution by loan originators" fetcher.

Logs into peerberry.com via pure HTTP by reusing
monitors.peerberry_monitor.login() (not duplicated here - same dependency
direction as swaper/lendermarket: login() lives in the monitor module,
which has no google_sheet dependency, and this module imports from it, not
the other way around) and fetches the per-loan-originator investment
breakdown that's shown on the Overview page under Investments > "Loan
originators" (amount invested + % of the portfolio, one row per
originator). No email is sent - the amounts are just logged and handed to
fill_current_month_amounts() (see google_sheet.py) so they can be filled
into a Google Sheet. The "total" ("en cours") written for the live current
month is invested + uninvested (available_money) - added 2026-08-14, per
explicit user request - unlike most other platforms here whose "total" is
invested-only (uninvested cash tracked separately via
fill_geographic_repartition_uninvested_amount).

`GET https://api.peerberry.com/v1/investor/overview/originators` (using the
`access_token` returned by monitors.peerberry_monitor.login() as an
`Authorization: Bearer` header, same as every other authenticated call).
Verified against the real account on 2026-07-09 (and re-verified via pure
HTTP on 2026-07-18): response is a JSON array of
`{"originator": "Lendplus ZA", "originatorId": 56, "company": "Aventus Group",
"companyId": 1, "iso2": "ZA", "amount": "1091.02", "part": "10.90"}`.

Also fetches this calendar month's "Interest income" from the Account
Summary API - see fetch_statement_summary() below, same idea as
swaper_diversification.fetch_current_month_interest_received().

Also computes a since-inception XIRR (money-weighted return) plus this
month's Cash drag and the XIRR Bonus / XIRR Cash drag / XIRR Taxes/Frais
pie-chart shares, mirroring afranga_diversification.py/
swaper_diversification.py's own XIRR block (see those modules' docstrings
for the full methodology) - added 2026-08-14, per explicit user request.
Unlike Lendermarket (no per-transaction ledger at all - only date-range
aggregates), PeerBerry DOES expose a genuine per-transaction dated ledger,
found via a real browser network capture of the Transactions section on
https://peerberry.com/en/client/statement/account-summary:

    GET https://api.peerberry.com/v2/investor/transactions?period=&startDate=<d1>&endDate=<d2>&loanId=&offset=<N>&pageSize=<N>
    -> a raw JSON array (no pagination metadata/total-count - the caller
    just keeps paginating via offset until a page comes back shorter than
    pageSize), one entry per transaction:
    `{"id": 336378843, "postDate": "2026-08-14 06:37:59", "details": "INVESTMENT",
      "loanId": 27686563, "investorId": 128112, "currencyIso": "EUR",
      "type": "INVESTMENT", "amount": "-100.00"}`.
`details` is one of the 7 categories PeerBerry's own `/v1/globals` response
enumerates under `transactionTypes` (DEPOSIT/WITHDRAWAL/REPAYMENT_PRINCIPAL/
REPAYMENT_INTEREST/INVESTMENT/INVESTMENT_SALE_FEE/REFERRAL_FEE); `type` is a
more granular technical flavor of the same thing (e.g. "BUYBACK_INTEREST"/
"BUYBACK_PRINCIPAL" when a repayment came via the buyback guarantee instead
of a normal scheduled one) - not needed here, `details` alone is enough to
classify every row. IMPORTANT: `amount` is already SIGNED to match its real
impact on the account's uninvested cash/wallet balance (DEPOSIT/REPAYMENT_*
positive, INVESTMENT negative) - confirmed by reconciling a real
account-summary response: `openingBalance + sum(operations.values()) ==
closingBalance` down to the cent (297.70 - 4390.36 + 5579.16 + 52.81 ==
1539.31) - so, unlike Swaper's account-entries rows (which need a
per-transactionType sign lookup table), this endpoint's own `amount` can be
summed directly, no sign-guessing needed.

Verified 2026-08-14 (dumping this account's entire history, 595 rows, via
pure HTTP with pageSize=20000): this account has only ever seen
DEPOSIT/INVESTMENT/BUYBACK_INTEREST/BUYBACK_PRINCIPAL rows so far - no
WITHDRAWAL/INVESTMENT_SALE_FEE/REFERRAL_FEE row exists yet to confirm their
real sign against a live example; REFERRAL_FEE is treated as a bonus/prime
credit (mirroring Swaper's referral bonus) and INVESTMENT_SALE_FEE as a
Taxes/Frais-bucket cost, both via the same add-back-and-recompute-XIRR
counterfactual technique as every other platform's Bonus/Taxes-Frais share
(sign-agnostic: it just cancels out whatever the lifetime sum's REAL sign
turns out to be) - so this is safe even though currently untested at 0.00.

IMPORTANT correction (found 2026-08-14 while adding this): a PREVIOUS
version of this module's fetch_current_month_statement_totals() docstring
claimed the account-summary API's `closingBalance` "IS the account's real
total invested+cash balance" and used it as a fallback `total` for a
backfilled month - that was WRONG. The reconciliation above proves
opening/closingBalance track the UNINVESTED CASH/WALLET balance only (it
drops when INVESTMENT happens, which doesn't change total portfolio value)
- confirmed live: `closingBalance` (1539.31) exactly equalled
`/v1/investor/overview`'s own `availableMoney` (1539.31) at the same
instant, not its `totalBalance` (10105.70). Backfilled-month `total` now
correctly uses skip_total (no historical total data source exists for this
platform, same as Lendermarket) instead of silently writing the wallet
balance into the "total invested" cell.

Added 2026-08-19: XIRR Intérêts, the counterfactual XIRR share
attributable to real net interest received since inception (mirrors
afranga_diversification.py's own XIRR Intérêts block exactly - same
counterfactual-XIRR pattern as Bonus/Cash drag/Taxes above). Unlike
Afranga (which has a real gross/withholding-tax split and must subtract
the two to get a net figure), PeerBerry's account-summary API has no such
split - `interest_income` (from fetch_statement_summary(), queried here
over the since-inception range already fetched for Cash drag/Taxes-Frais,
no extra fetch needed) already IS the lifetime net interest figure, so it
is used directly as `lifetime_net_interest`. As with Afranga, a "XIRR
Intérêts" row must already exist in the PeerBerry block on the sheet
itself (right after "XIRR Taxes/Frais") for this new value to land
anywhere - fill_current_month_bonus_breakdown() fills an existing row by
label, it doesn't insert new labelled rows. `max_rows` is bumped 14 -> 15
to keep the search bounded past this now-taller block.

BUGFIX 2026-08-21: a backfill run (scripts/run_diversification_for_month_
range.sh, which simulates get_report_now() as an arbitrary day within a
target month) for the CURRENT calendar month was able to trigger the
XIRR/transactions block below, because is_current_month() only compares
the MONTH, not the exact simulated day. When the simulated day is in the
future relative to the real wall-clock day (e.g. a backfill run using
today_date=2026-08-31 while the real date is 2026-08-20), that future date
got passed into get_cached_transactions() and persisted as
last_fetched_date in XIRR_CASHFLOWS_STATE_FILE. The NEXT real run then
called the transactions API with startDate (2026-08-31) AFTER endDate
(2026-08-20) - an inverted range - which PeerBerry's API rejects with a
422, breaking XIRR/Cash drag/Taxes-Frais/Intérêts for that run. Fixed by
gating the transactions/XIRR block on a new `is_real_today` check (today_
date must equal the REAL wall-clock day in REPORT_TIMEZONE, not just be in
the current real month) in addition to `current_month`, and by making
fetch_all_transactions() refuse to call the API at all with an inverted
date range (defense in depth, in case a stale/poisoned cache slips through
some other way). No change to any XIRR/Cash drag/Taxes-Frais/Intérêts
calculation itself - only to when the fetch that feeds them is allowed to
run and persist its cache.

Added 2026-09-07: XIRR block support for a BACKFILLED (non-current) month,
mirroring the same correction already applied to
afranga_diversification.py (see its module docstring for the full
methodology) - previously the entire XIRR/Cash drag/Bonus/Taxes-Frais/
Intérêts block was silently skipped for any backfilled month. For a
backfilled month, the account's invested principal ("outstanding") as of
that month's own end_date is reconstructed by replaying every cached
transaction row's effect on it (reconstruct_outstanding(), classifying
each row via its `details` value - INVESTMENT/REPAYMENT_PRINCIPAL affect
outstanding, everything else is wallet-only) instead of using the LIVE
originator-distribution total, and the terminal account value is that
reconstructed outstanding plus the account-summary API's own
closingBalance as of end_date - see compute_xirr_block_as_of(). The
`is_real_today` BUGFIX above still applies unchanged: a backfilled month
never calls get_cached_transactions() (no fetch, no persisted
last_fetched_date) - it only reads whatever's already cached from a
previous REAL run and filters it down to its own end_date, so this
addition carries no risk of re-triggering the 2026-08-21 incident.

Added 2026-09-09: switched the XIRR Bonus/Cash drag/Taxes-Frais/Intérêts
shares from isolated counterfactuals (cancel ONE factor, XIRR_real -
XIRR_without that factor) to a proper Shapley-value decomposition (see
shared/xirr_shapley.py's module docstring) - the old method left an
unexplained gap between XIRR and the sum of its "explaining" shares
because XIRR is non-linear in its cashflows (interaction effects between
factors were silently dropped). Shapley shares are additive by
construction: XIRR Bonus + XIRR Cash drag + XIRR Taxes + XIRR Frais + XIRR
Intérêts now sums back to XIRR real - XIRR with every factor neutralized
(checked at runtime, warns if off by more than 0.0001). Also split the old
single "XIRR Taxes/Frais" share into "XIRR Taxes" and "XIRR Frais" -
INVESTMENT_SALE_FEE is confirmed a genuine platform FEE concept (never
observed to actually fire on the tested account, always 0.0 in practice),
now correctly mapped to "XIRR Frais" - "XIRR Taxes" is hardcoded to 0.0
(PeerBerry has no withholding-tax data source at all).
