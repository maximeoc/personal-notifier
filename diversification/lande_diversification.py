"""Lande Finance (lande.finance) account balance + this month's interest
fetcher.

Same family as mintos_diversification.py: pure `requests` (no Playwright at
runtime), authenticated with 3 session cookies captured by the separate
LOCAL-only lande_get_session.py helper (see that file's docstring for why
login can't be automated here). No email is sent - same as every other
diversification script; feeds fill_current_month_amounts() (see
google_sheet.py) so it can be filled into the Google Sheet.

Why login is manual (mirrors Mintos, but for a different underlying
reason): lande.finance's login page is protected by a Cloudflare Turnstile
"I'm not a robot" managed challenge that DETECTS Playwright/CDP-driven
automation and loops the challenge forever - confirmed 2026-07-29 across
TWO separate mitigation attempts (plain bundled Chromium; real Chrome via
`channel="chrome"` PLUS this repo's shared/browser_stealth.py patches -
navigator.webdriver override, realistic UA/viewport, human-like mouse
movement), both failed identically (URL's `__cf_chl_rt_tk` challenge token
changes on every retry, session never reaches /investor). This matches the
same class of blocker already documented for Go & Grow's Keycloak login
before its pure-HTTP rewrite: the CDP automation protocol itself is the
detected signal, not a UA/fingerprint-level tell fixable via JS patches.
WORKAROUND THAT WORKS (verified 2026-07-29): launch the user's REAL Chrome
as a plain OS subprocess (NOT through Playwright's launch mechanism at
all, so none of Playwright's automation flags/CDP launch signature are
present) with `--remote-debugging-port`, let the user log in 100%
manually (the Turnstile challenge passes normally in this genuinely
non-automated browser), THEN attach Playwright via `connect_over_cdp()`
purely to read the resulting cookies - see lande_get_session.py. Once
past login, the actual DATA endpoints are NOT bot-protected at all: a
plain `requests.Session()` seeded with the captured cookies (cf_clearance,
lande_session, XSRF-TOKEN) gets normal 200 responses with zero further
challenge (verified live 2026-07-29 - same "browser-only-for-the-hard-part,
pure-HTTP-for-the-easy-part" split already used for Mintos, for a
different underlying gate).

Session cookies (LANDE_CF_CLEARANCE / LANDE_LANDE_SESSION /
LANDE_XSRF_TOKEN env vars): unlike Mintos's self-renewing cookies, Lande's
`cf_clearance`/session lifetimes are NOT specifically characterized here -
if a run fails with the "session expired" message below, just re-run
lande_get_session.py locally to get fresh values.

Data sources (server-rendered HTML - lande.finance is a Laravel app, NOT a
JSON API - confirmed via the XSRF-TOKEN/lande_session cookie naming and
verified live 2026-07-29):
- `GET https://lande.finance/fr/investor/transactions?search=1&
  start_date=<DD.MM.YYYY>&end_date=<DD.MM.YYYY>&page=<N>` -> paginated
  (15 rows/page, confirmed via the page's own "Showing X to Y of Z"
  footer) list of `<article>` blocks, one per transaction. Each interest
  entry looks like:
  `<span class="capitalize">Intérêt</span>...<span class="text-brand-green">
  +€&nbsp;1.14</span>` (loan link + date also present, not needed here).
  Other transaction types seen: "Principal", "Demande de retrait"
  (withdrawal request) - ignored, only "Intérêt"-labelled entries are
  summed for gross interest. No separate withholding-tax transaction type
  was found on this account (net == gross, tax = 0.0, same convention as
  Swaper/Loanch/Iuvo/etc. for platforms with no tax breakdown). Pagination
  continues until a page returns zero `<article>` blocks (capped by
  MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PAGES as a safety net, same pattern as
  bienpreter_diversification.py's operations pagination).
- **"total" (the account balance figure) comes from the "Compte de
  résultat" (tax report) button, same period as the interest above** -
  found 2026-08-04 (correcting the earlier note here that assumed this was
  unusable): the button's real link is
  `GET https://lande.finance/fr/investor/transactions/tax-report?search=1&
  start_date=<DD.MM.YYYY>&end_date=<DD.MM.YYYY>` and IS a real
  `application/pdf` response (confirmed via Playwright's
  `context.request.get()`, which - unlike `page.goto()` - returns the raw
  PDF bytes instead of Chrome's built-in PDF-viewer's empty embedder
  shell). Parsed with PyMuPDF (`fitz`, new dependency) - the PDF's plain
  text includes a line "2. Account value at the end of the period"
  immediately followed by a line like "946.57 EUR" - that's the figure
  used for "total", NOT the investor overview page's always-CURRENT
  `id="total_balance"` value (which was used before this fix, but is wrong
  for any REPORT_DATE-driven past month - it only ever reflects today's
  live balance). Fetching the SAME period as the interest means requesting
  an old month (via REPORT_DATE/run_manual_platform.ps1's date prompt)
  now gives that month's real historical end-of-period balance instead of
  today's balance. Verified live 2026-08-04 (period 01.07.2026-31.07.2026):
  946.57 EUR, matching the previously-verified 2026-07-29 live balance.

Real bonus transactions DO occur on this account (confirmed live
2026-08-14, correcting the earlier claim here that none had been seen):
"Bonus d'affiliation" and "Bonus de parrainage" entries on the
transactions page, both positive amounts. `bonus_cashback_contest` still
defaults to 0.0 (no dedicated cashback-style transaction type has been
seen, only bonus) - the two real bonus types are instead folded into the
XIRR Bonus share below, same as Loanch's "prime"/Loanch's `total_bonus`.

Also computes a since-inception XIRR (money-weighted return) plus this
month's Cash drag and the XIRR Bonus / XIRR Cash drag / XIRR Taxes/Frais
pie-chart shares - added 2026-08-14 per explicit user request, mirroring
Afranga/Swaper/Lendermarket/PeerBerry/Loanch/Mintos's own XIRR blocks.
Unlike those platforms, Lande has no JSON transaction API - every
transaction type is scraped straight off the server-rendered
`<article>` blocks on /investor/transactions (same markup already used
by fetch_current_month_interest()), enumerated live 2026-08-14 by
paginating the ENTIRE account history (01.01.2015 to today): `Intérêt`
(interest, internal), `Principal` (principal repaid, internal),
`Investissement` (money moved into a loan, internal), `Demande de
retrait` (withdrawal - EXTERNAL cashflow), `Dépôt par virement bancaire`
(deposit - EXTERNAL cashflow), `Bonus d'affiliation` / `Bonus de
parrainage` (real bonus money, own XIRR Bonus share). Every entry's
amount is already SIGNED for its real cash-balance impact (green "+"
increases the wallet, red "-" decreases it - verified against the
"Fonds disponibles" figure), so `compute_average_idle_cash()` can
reconstruct a running daily wallet balance from scratch (starting at 0
on the very first transaction's date, same trick as
loanch_diversification.py - no separate opening-balance anchor needed).
No withholding-tax-style transaction has ever been observed on this
account - any future/unrecognized label (i.e. none of the 7 known ones
above) is tracked as "unclassified" and logged as a warning if ever
non-zero, rather than being folded into any XIRR Taxes/Frais share (see
the 2026-09-09 correction note below) - same defensive tracking as
Loanch's unclassified `transaction_type` bucket. Since this account's full history
is currently only ~11 pages (~160 rows), the full range is simply
re-fetched every run - no incremental cache file, unlike the much larger
Mintos/PeerBerry/Loanch ledgers (revisit this if Lande's history ever
grows large enough to make that slow).

Added 2026-08-19: XIRR Intérêts, the counterfactual XIRR share
attributable to real net interest received since inception (mirrors
loanch_diversification.py's/mintos_diversification.py's/
bienpreter_diversification.py's/afranga_diversification.py's/
iuvo_diversification.py's/lendermarket_diversification.py's own XIRR
Intérêts blocks). Like Loanch (and unlike Mintos), Lande has no separate
gross/withholding-tax split on interest (net == gross, tax = 0.0 - see
above), so "lifetime net interest" here is simply the sum of every
"Intérêt"-labelled entry's own signed amount since inception
(`lifetime_interest`, already computed in the Cash drag lifetime block
below for the lifetime yield rate - reused, not recomputed). Same
reasoning as the other platforms: "Intérêts" was previously only ever a
RESIDUAL on the spreadsheet/dashboard side (XIRR - XIRR Bonus - XIRR Cash
drag - XIRR Taxes/Frais), which can legitimately go negative or misleading
depending on the other shares' relative size - XIRR Intérêts instead
gives a genuine, independently-measured figure (same category of
computation as Bonus/Cash drag/Taxes, not a derived leftover), so the two
can be compared/sanity-checked against each other on the sheet/dashboard
side.

The "Répartition géographique" section has a "Lande" row followed by a
"non investi" row and one row PER ACTIVE LOAN (named by Lande loan id), like
Bienprêter's per-borrower rows: fill_lande_loan_geo_amounts() puts each
loan's remaining principal in its country column (ISO code from the
/fr/investor/investments table), writes a SOMME total per row, rewrites the
"Lande" row itself as sums of its sub-rows and deletes rows of loans no
longer active. All non-repaid payment_status filters are read because the
default view hides "Défaut" loans; the sum is cross-checked against
"Fonds investis" before anything is written.

Added 2026-09-07: the whole XIRR block (Cash drag, XIRR, XIRR Intérêts,
XIRR Bonus, XIRR Cash drag, XIRR Taxes/Frais) can now ALSO be computed for a
BACKFILLED (past) month, not just the live current one - mirroring
afranga_diversification.py's/mintos_diversification.py's own backfill
ports, but simpler here since `total` is already the real period-end value
from the tax-report PDF and `all_entries` is already filtered to `end_date`,
which respects REPORT_DATE. The historical wallet balance is reconstructed
by replaying the ledger's signed transaction amounts, so `total_invested` and
both Cash drag metrics are available for backfills too. For the live current
month, the independently fetched "Fonds disponibles" snapshot remains
authoritative and is cross-checked against that replay.

Added 2026-09-09: switched the XIRR Bonus/Cash drag/Taxes/Intérêts shares
from isolated counterfactuals (cancel ONE factor, XIRR_real - XIRR_without
that factor) to a proper Shapley-value decomposition (see
shared/xirr_shapley.py's module docstring) - the old method left an
unexplained gap between XIRR and the sum of its "explaining" shares
because XIRR is non-linear in its cashflows (interaction effects between
factors were silently dropped). Shapley shares are additive by
construction: XIRR Bonus + XIRR Cash drag + XIRR Taxes + XIRR Frais + XIRR
Intérêts now sums back to XIRR real - XIRR with every factor neutralized
(checked at runtime, warns if off by more than 0.0001). Also split the old
single "XIRR Taxes/Frais" share into "XIRR Taxes" and "XIRR Frais" -
Lande has NO withholding-tax-style transaction AND no distinct fee concept
of its own, so both are hardcoded to 0.0, not computed via Shapley.

Corrected 2026-09-09: the "unclassified" catch-all (any future/
unrecognized label) used to be folded into "XIRR Taxes" - dropped, since
that's not a confirmed real tax and mislabelling it as one is incorrect.
It has never been non-zero on this account; if it ever is, `run()` now
just logs a warning (lifetime_unclassified) instead of silently
attributing it to Taxes.

run() accepts an optional pre-built `requests.Session` (see
lande_get_session.py) for a one-shot "log in by hand, then let this take
over" flow - the env vars below are only required when calling run() with
no session (the normal scheduled/headless case).
