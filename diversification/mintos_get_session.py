"""LOCAL-ONLY helper: opens a new tab in your REAL Chrome (a plain OS
process, not launched through Playwright) on mintos.com and
automatically fills in your email/password (MINTOS_EMAIL/MINTOS_PASSWORD)
and, if a 2FA page appears, your TOTP code (MINTOS_TOTP_SECRET) - then
captures the resulting session cookies and immediately runs the full
mintos_diversification.py fetch + Google Sheet update using that fresh
session, with no copy-pasting required. The ONLY thing you might still
need to do by hand is solve a CAPTCHA puzzle, IF Mintos happens to show
one (see below) - everything else is automatic.

Why the CAPTCHA can't be automated (but everything else now is, as of
2026-07-29): Mintos's login is gated by Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise (site
key `6Ldx1tcpAAAAAHgB7BUqc2A4h1Jn8ECfq416N2wT`), confirmed ADAPTIVE/
risk-based - it can show a real interactive puzzle even for a fully
genuine login with correct credentials, unpredictably (verified live
2026-07-29: the exact same credentials triggered a real interactive
puzzle on one run). Per this repo's security policy, CAPTCHAs are never
solved/bypassed programmatically, so there is no reliable way to automate
that ONE step - if it appears, this script pauses and asks you to solve
it in the visible window, then continues automatically from there
(including automating the 2FA step that follows, so you don't need to
type your TOTP code either).

Real Chrome vs. Playwright-launched Chromium: a real Chrome started as a
normal process (with `--remote-debugging-port` and a persistent dedicated
profile) has no automation launch signature and keeps its cookies/history
between runs, which gives reCAPTCHA a much better trust signal than a blank
fresh Chromium every time. It is NOT your everyday Chrome profile: since
Chrome 136, `--remote-debugging-port` is ignored on the default profile, so
a separate profile (kept in your home folder) is used. If a Chrome with that
profile is already running on the debug port, a new tab is opened in it.

Usage: `python -m diversification.mintos_get_session`
1. A tab opens in real Chrome on the Mintos login page.
2. Email/password are filled and submitted automatically.
3. IF a CAPTCHA puzzle appears on THIS login/password page (unpredictable,
   detected by looking for the reCAPTCHA iframe), the script pauses and
   asks you to solve it AND submit the form yourself in the window, then
   press Enter here - it then waits for the resulting navigation instead
   of assuming it already happened.
4. IF a 2FA page appears, the TOTP code is filled and submitted
   automatically (tries the current/previous/next 30s window for clock-
   drift safety, same pattern as afranga_diversification.py). IF a
   SEPARATE CAPTCHA puzzle appears on THIS 2FA page (checked independently
   of step 3's), the script pauses again the same way, then keeps trying
   TOTP candidates once you've submitted it.
5. The script detects the moment you're fully logged in (URL leaves
   /login entirely), automatically captures the PHPSESSID/MW_SESSION_ID
   session cookies, and immediately calls
   `mintos_diversification.run(session=...)` with them - the account's
   current data is fetched and written to the Google Sheet right away.
6. The two cookie values are also printed at the end - copy them into your
   local .env and the GitHub repository secrets (Settings > Secrets and
   variables > Actions) of the same names, so the scheduled/cron-job.org
   -triggered workflow can keep reusing this session headlessly afterward
   without needing a fresh manual login every time.

The Mintos session cookie renews itself on every authenticated request (a
fresh `Set-Cookie` with a later `Expires` came back on every API call tested
2026-07-24), so as long as something using these cookies runs at least once
within roughly 15 minutes of the last use, the session should keep sliding
forward indefinitely without needing to re-run this script. If the
scheduled job's cadence is sparser than that, or the account gets logged out
for any other reason, the next scheduled run will fail with a clear
"session expired" error (see mintos_diversification.py) telling you to
re-run this script.

Required env vars: MINTOS_EMAIL, MINTOS_PASSWORD, MINTOS_TOTP_SECRET (used
only locally by this helper to fill the login/2FA forms - never sent
anywhere but Mintos's own login form) - GOOGLE_SHEET_ID/GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS
are still needed (transitively, by mintos_diversification.run()) to write
the fetched data to the Sheet.
