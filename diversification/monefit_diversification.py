"""Monefit (SmartSaver) account balance fetcher.

Same idea as afranga_diversification.py / peerberry_diversification.py /
lendermarket_diversification.py / loanch_diversification.py, but simpler:
Monefit SmartSaver is a single savings product (not a marketplace split
across many loan originators), so there's nothing to group/aggregate - this
just logs into https://smartsaver.monefit.com, reads the account's "Total
Wealth" balance, and hands it to fill_current_month_amounts() (see
google_sheet.py) as a single-entry list using "monefit" as the loan
originator label, mirroring the {"originator", "outstanding"} shape used by
afranga_diversification.py. No email is sent - same as the other
diversification scripts.

REWRITTEN 2026-07-18 to use plain `requests` instead of Playwright (no
browser at all), same technique as bricks_diversification.py /
goandgrow_diversification.py / bienpreter_diversification.py - much faster
in GitHub Actions. Verified live: Monefit's backend (a separate API host,
`api-smartsaver.monefit.com`) has NO Cloudflare/bot-protection at all and
returns the JWT directly in the login response body (no DOM-interception
trick needed like the old Playwright version had to use for the account
summary call).

Login mechanism (verified 2026-07-18): `POST
https://api-smartsaver.monefit.com/v1/auth/login` with JSON body
`{"identificator": <email>, "password": <password>}` (NOT `"email"` - that
field name returns a 401 "Incorrect e-mail or password" even with correct
credentials, `"identificator"` is the field the SPA actually uses) returns
`{"data": {"result": {"mfa": false, "token": "<JWT>", ...}}}` - the JWT is
used as a `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on every subsequent API
call. `mfa` is `false` on this account (confirmed no 2FA/TOTP step exists,
consistent with the original 2026-07-09 Playwright build's observation).

Balance: `GET https://api-smartsaver.monefit.com/v1/vaults` returns
`{"data": {"total": "...", "totalWealth": "5194.02522602", "mainAccount":
"...", "result": [...per-vault details...]}}` - `totalWealth` matches the
summary endpoint's `closingBalance` (see below) and is the same figure
shown as "Total Wealth" on the summary page.

This month's stats: `GET
https://api-smartsaver.monefit.com/v1/account/summary?dateFrom=<1st of
month>&dateTo=<today>` returns `{"data": {"result": {"openingBalance":
..., "closingBalance": ..., "interestIncome": "0.00000408", "bonus":
"0.00000000", "maturedVaults": "0", ...}}}` - same fields/semantics as the
old Playwright version's `page.expect_response()` capture of this same
endpoint (the SPA calls it itself); "Current month" default window
(1st of the current month through TODAY).

Also computes a since-inception XIRR (money-weighted return) plus this
month's Cash drag and the XIRR Bonus / XIRR Cash drag / XIRR Taxes/Frais /
XIRR Intérêts pie-chart shares (see run() below) - same monthly-aggregate
methodology as lendermarket_diversification.py/iuvo_diversification.py
(Monefit's account/summary endpoint only returns aggregate totals for a
queried range, no per-transaction dated ledger, unlike
afranga/peerberry/swaper).

Added 2026-08-19: XIRR Intérêts, the counterfactual XIRR share
attributable to real net interest received since inception (mirrors
afranga_diversification.py's/peerberry_diversification.py's/
swaper_diversification.py's own XIRR Intérêts block exactly - same
counterfactual-XIRR pattern as Bonus/Cash drag/Taxes above, computed in
the same block as cash_drag_xirr_contribution, reusing the already-summed
`lifetime_interest_total` - no extra fetch needed). Like Swaper/PeerBerry
(and unlike Afranga, which has a real gross/withholding-tax split to
subtract), Monefit's account/summary API has no withholding-tax data at
all (withholding_tax defaults to 0.0 above) - so `lifetime_interest_total`
(the sum of each cached month's "daily_returns"/interestIncome) already IS
the lifetime net interest figure, used directly as `lifetime_net_interest`.
As with the other platforms, a "XIRR Intérêts" row must already exist in
the Monefit block on the sheet itself (right after "XIRR Taxes/Frais") for
this new value to land anywhere - fill_current_month_bonus_breakdown()
fills an existing row by label, it doesn't insert new labelled rows.
`max_rows` is bumped 14 -> 15 to keep the search bounded past this now-
taller block.

Added 2026-09-07: "XIRR"/"XIRR Bonus"/"XIRR Taxes/Frais"/"XIRR Intérêts"
can now ALSO be computed for a BACKFILLED (past) REPORT_DATE month, not
just the real current month - each cached monthly summary already carries
a real `closing_balance` (verified to match live "Total Wealth"), which IS
the terminal value for a backfilled month, so no reconstruction is needed
the way afranga_diversification.py's own backfill support needs
reconstruct_outstanding(). "Cash drag"/"XIRR Cash drag" STAY
current-month-only (genuinely infeasible to backfill): they need
`vaults["invested"]`/`vaults["main_account"]`, both LIVE-only snapshots
with no historical per-date equivalent anywhere on this platform (see the
comment above `avg_idle_cash`'s own docstring paragraph). "Solde moyen
pondéré non investi" stays current-month-only for the same reason, but
"investi" is backfillable (added 2026-09-11) using that same month's
`closing_balance` as a stand-in - SmartSaver auto-invests deposits into a
vault almost immediately, so idle cash (and thus real cash drag) is
normally negligible anyway, making closing_balance a good-enough proxy for
"investi" on a past month.

Added 2026-09-09: switched the XIRR Bonus/Cash drag/Frais/Intérêts shares
from isolated counterfactuals (cancel ONE factor, XIRR_real - XIRR_without
that factor) to a proper Shapley-value decomposition (see
shared/xirr_shapley.py's module docstring) - the old method left an
unexplained gap between XIRR and the sum of its "explaining" shares
because XIRR is non-linear in its cashflows (interaction effects between
factors were silently dropped). Shapley shares are additive by
construction: XIRR Bonus + XIRR Cash drag + XIRR Frais + XIRR Intérêts now
sums back to XIRR real - XIRR with every factor neutralized (checked at
runtime, warns if off by more than 0.0001). IMPORTANT sign-flip vs most
other platforms: Monefit has real, genuine platform fees ("fees" field,
see below) but NO withholding-tax data at all, so "XIRR Taxes" is
hardcoded to 0.0 - the old code mislabelled this exact same fee-based
counterfactual as "taxes_xirr_contribution"/"XIRR Taxes/Frais" (the
"taxes/frais" log message name was itself a hint this was ambiguous) - now
correctly attributed to "XIRR Frais" only.

Added 2026-10-04: vault interest. account/summary's interestIncome/bonus
only cover main-account interest and rewards - interest accruing inside
vaults (~39 EUR/month here) is in neither, yet is part of the "Total Wealth"
closing balance. fetch_statement_summary() derives it as `vault_interest` =
closing - opening - net deposits - interestIncome - bonus + fees (verified
against the sum of the vaults' own `earned` fields), and it is now added to
interest everywhere (Sheet "interets brut", XIRR waterfalls, Cash drag,
monthly yield waterfall). Old caches without it are refetched once.
