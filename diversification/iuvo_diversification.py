"""Iuvo (iuvo-group.com) portfolio balance + loan-originator diversification
fetcher.

REWRITTEN 2026-07-27 to use plain `requests` instead of Playwright (no
browser at all) - same technique as bricks_diversification.py/
monefit_diversification.py/goandgrow_diversification.py. The original
Playwright-based version (verified working end-to-end the same day, prior
to this rewrite) was replaced after network-capturing a real login: despite
Cloudflare fronting tbp2p.iuvo-group.com (`cf-ray`/`server: cloudflare`
response headers, and a passive `cdn-cgi/challenge-platform` JS beacon
observed during normal page loads), a direct non-browser `requests` POST to
the login endpoint is NOT blocked - confirmed 2026-07-27 end-to-end against
the real account (login + balance/originator breakdown + date-filtered
account statement all succeeded with a plain `requests.Session()`). No
storage_state/cookie persistence across runs is implemented either, same
as bricks/monefit/goandgrow - logging in fresh every run is cheap.

Underlying architecture: legacy "TeleBid/TB p2p" white-label engine (the
same backend engine also runs Swaper - see swaper_diversification.py -
but that's a separate deployment; don't assume this pure-HTTP technique
transfers there without re-testing).

Auth mechanism: `POST https://tbp2p.iuvo-group.com/p2p-ui/?p0=login;=en_US;
randn=<random 0..1>` with form-urlencoded body `login=<email>&password=
<password>` returns `{"result": {"session_token": "<32-char hex>", ...},
"status": {"status": "ok"}}` - this `session_token` (NOT a cookie) must be
passed as the `p2=` query-string param on every subsequent
tbp2p.iuvo-group.com API call. `token_expiration_seconds` is only 300 (5
minutes), but a full run of this script takes a few seconds, well within
that window - no refresh logic implemented. A `PHPSESSID` cookie is also
set by the main iuvo-group.com WordPress site (harmless/unused by the API
calls themselves; `requests.Session()` carries it automatically anyway).

Data sources (both real endpoints, found 2026-07-27 by capturing a
Playwright-driven browser's network traffic during exploration):
  - `GET https://tbp2p.iuvo-group.com/p2p-ui/v2/app?p0=overview_page;
    p2=<token>;lang=en_US&screen_width=1280&screen_height=720` -> a
    server-rendered HTML page (NOT a JSON API) that embeds a
    `var investors = [{...}];` JavaScript literal directly in a `<script>`
    tag - this is FULL-PRECISION JSON (unlike the "Chart by loans" widget
    rendered from the same data, which visually rounds to the nearest
    whole EUR). `investors[0].accountBalance` has: `availableFunds` =
    "Available Funds", `investedFunds` = "Receivables in P2P",
    `productInvestedFunds` = "Receivables in iuvoSAVE", `totalAmount` =
    "Total" (verified 2026-07-27: 0.00 + 1000.00 + 0.00 = 1000.00 EUR,
    same real-account figures as the original Playwright version).
    `investmentsByLoanOriginator` is a list of
    `{"aggregator": <name>, "value": <exact float>, "percentage": <pct>}`
    - `value` is used DIRECTLY as each originator's amount (no more
    percentage-of-total computation trick needed like Swaper/Bricks, since
    this `value` is already full precision - confirmed 2026-07-27:
    VivaCredit value=1000.0, exact match with investedFunds).
  - `GET https://tbp2p.iuvo-group.com/p2p-ui/v2/app?p0=
    account_statement_grouped_page;p2=<token>;lang=en_US&screen_width=
    1280&screen_height=720` (no extra params) - called ONCE first just to
    scrape `investor_account_id` (a stable per-currency-account id, e.g.
    29101 for this EUR account) out of the pre-selected
    `<option value="29101" selected="selected">EUR (€)</option>` in the
    page's own "Accounts" filter `<select>` - then the SAME endpoint is
    called AGAIN with `investor_account_id=<id>&trans_category=all&
    date_from=<1st of month>&date_to=<today>&p2=<token>&lang=en_US&
    screen_width=...&screen_height=...` added, which returns the actual
    date-filtered `<table class="table table-bordered p2p-table">` (this
    table's rows are technically malformed HTML - missing `</tr>` closing
    tags - so it's parsed with a regex matching each row's
    `<a class="btn p2p-trans" value="TYPE">...</a></td><td class="
    (positive|negative)-turnover">AMOUNT</td>` pair directly, rather than
    per-`<tr>` DOM/BeautifulSoup parsing, verified 2026-07-27 to correctly
    extract both rows of a real 2-row statement). Same `trans_type`
    classification convention as the original Playwright version:
    `payment_interest`/`payment_interest_buyback`/`payment_interest_early`
    summed into gross interest, `bonus` summed into
    bonus_cashback_contest. Iuvo has no separate withholding-tax
    transaction type, so net_interest_received == gross_interest_received
    and withholding_tax defaults to 0.0 (same convention as
    Swaper/Loanch/etc.).

Added 2026-08-18: XIRR Intérêts, the counterfactual XIRR share
attributable to real net interest received since inception (mirrors
bienpreter_diversification.py's/afranga_diversification.py's own XIRR
Intérêts blocks). Since Iuvo has no withholding tax at all (see above -
net_interest_received == gross_interest_received always), "lifetime net
interest" here is simply the sum of every cached month's own
gross_interest_received - no separate gross/tax reconstruction needed,
unlike Bienprêter/Afranga. This exists because "Intérêts" was previously
only ever a RESIDUAL on the spreadsheet/dashboard side (XIRR - XIRR Bonus
- XIRR Cash drag - XIRR Taxes/Frais), which can legitimately go negative
when the bonus's counterfactual XIRR share is disproportionately large
relative to the account's real underlying (non-bonus) performance - that's
not a bug, it's the correct signal that the account's return is propped up
almost entirely by the bonus. XIRR Intérêts instead gives a genuine,
independently-measured figure (same category of computation as Bonus, not
a derived leftover), so the two can be compared/sanity-checked against
each other on the sheet/dashboard side.

Added 2026-09-09: switched the XIRR Bonus/Cash drag/Intérêts shares from
isolated counterfactuals (cancel ONE factor, XIRR_real - XIRR_without that
factor) to a proper Shapley-value decomposition (see
shared/xirr_shapley.py's module docstring) - the old method left an
unexplained gap between XIRR and the sum of its "explaining" shares
because XIRR is non-linear in its cashflows (interaction effects between
factors were silently dropped). Shapley shares are additive by
construction: XIRR Bonus + XIRR Cash drag + XIRR Intérêts now sums back to
XIRR real - XIRR with every factor neutralized (checked at runtime, warns
if off by more than 0.0001). Also split the old single "XIRR Taxes/Frais"
share into "XIRR Taxes" and "XIRR Frais" - Iuvo has NEITHER a withholding-
tax transaction type NOR a distinct platform-fee transaction type at all,
so BOTH are hardcoded to 0.0, not computed via Shapley (neither is part of
the game).

UPDATE 2026-09-07 (implemented after all - backward reconstruction,
supersedes the "NOT IMPLEMENTED" finding below): forward-reconstructing
`total_invested` (the live `balance_data["total"] - available_funds`
split for a past date) is still impossible for the reason below, but
total_account_value at a past `today_date` CAN be derived BACKWARD from
TODAY's known live `balance_data["total"]`: every cached month's own
`deposits`/`withdrawals`/`gross_interest_received`/`bonus_cashback_contest`
already capture every real external cashflow/earning that occurred - so
subtracting the sum of those fields for every month AFTER `today_date`'s
own month from today's live total gives that month's real
total_account_value, with no need to ever know the live-only invested/
wallet split for a past date at all. `total_invested` at that date then
falls out as a remainder (that total minus the month's own real closing
wallet balance, already cached). This is what now lets XIRR/Cash drag/the
pie-chart shares be computed for a backfilled month too (previously
current-month-only) - see run()'s `real_today`/`monthly_summaries_as_of`
split. "total" itself still isn't written for a backfilled month (still
skip_total, unchanged).

ORIGINAL 2026-09-07 finding (still true, explains why FORWARD
reconstruction specifically doesn't work): `total_invested` here is
`balance_data["total"] - balance_data["available_funds"]`, itself built
from the LIVE `investors[0].accountBalance` JS literal on the
`overview_page` (no date param exists for it) - there is no way to know
what this figure actually WAS on some past date without a genuine
per-transaction dated ledger (the date-filtered `account_statement_grouped_page`
call above only returns TYPE-GROUPED totals for a queried range, no
running/closing-balance field for the INVESTED portion specifically).
