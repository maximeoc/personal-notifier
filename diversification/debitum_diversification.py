"""Debitum Investments portfolio diversification (by lending company)
fetcher.

Debitum (debitum.investments) is a Latvian business-loan crowdlending
platform. Its frontend is a React SPA calling a JSON REST API under
debitum.investments/gtw/... (an internal API gateway, "gtw" prefix) -
pure HTTP, no Playwright/browser needed (same category as Nectaro/Go &
Grow/Bricks/Iuvo).

Auth flow (reverse-engineered 2026-09-08 via a real login + Playwright
network capture, then independently replayed with a plain
`requests.Session()` - see repo memory for the full exploration):
  1. Submitting the login form (email/password) does NOT itself validate
     credentials against the server - it just navigates the SPA to
     /fr/confirm-login (the 2FA code entry screen), client-side only. The
     actual authentication happens in ONE combined call once the TOTP code
     is entered:
     `POST https://debitum.investments/gtw/oauth/token`
     `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
     body: `username=<email>&password=<password>&grant_type=password&
     client_id=debitumapp&client_secret=x58GUKN8TQHB3FG&
     verification_code=<6-digit TOTP code>`
     (`client_id`/`client_secret` are hardcoded, public values baked into
     the frontend JS bundle - not a per-user secret, confirmed identical
     across runs - safe to hardcode here too, same as the app itself does)
     -> `{"access_token": <JWT>, "refresh_token": <str>, "token_type":
     "Bearer", "expires_in": 599}` (~10 min lifetime - a single run
     finishes in seconds, no refresh-token handling needed).
  2. A second call, `POST https://debitum.investments/gtw/2fa` with
     `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` and JSON body
     `{"confirmationCode": <same TOTP code>}`, is ALSO fired by the real
     UI right after (empty response) - replicated here for parity with
     the real login flow, though it was not proven strictly required for
     subsequent API calls to succeed.
  3. Every subsequent authenticated call sends `Authorization: Bearer
     <access_token>` (confirmed live: without this header, even a
     structurally-valid request gets HTTP 401 "Access Denied" - session
     cookies set during login are NOT sufficient on their own).

Data endpoints (all under debitum.investments/gtw/..., `Authorization:
Bearer` auth):
  - `GET /gtw/loans/api/balances` -> `investedEur` (current outstanding/
    invested total) and `fiatEur` (uninvested cash wallet, "non investi").
  - `GET /gtw/loans/api/investments/charts` -> `loanOriginatorChart.
    entries: [{"originatorName", "amount"}, ...]` - the CURRENT outstanding
    amount per lending company, used directly for the "Répartition
    géographique" breakdown (no percentage-multiplication trick needed,
    unlike Swaper/Iuvo - this is already an absolute EUR figure per
    company).
  - `POST /gtw/loans/api/balances/v3/transactions-summary` body
    `{"transactionTypes": [], "periodFrame": "CUSTOM"|"ALLTIME",
    "period": {"start": "YYYY-MM-DD", "end": "YYYY-MM-DD"}|null}` -> a
    SERVER-SIDE PRE-AGGREGATED summary for the given range: `interest`
    (gross interest received), `totalTax` (withholding tax), `bonusReferral`
    (referral/loyalty bonus - AFFILIATE-type transactions), `principal`.
    GOTCHA (found 2026-10-02): the period keys are `start`/`end`; the old
    `from`/`to` were silently ignored, so every CUSTOM call returned LIFETIME
    totals (interest, tax and bonus all wrong per month).
    An EMPTY `transactionTypes` array means "every type included" (per
    explicit user request "regarde dans le filtre tout les transactions
    type pour tous les prendre en compte") - confirmed live this is the
    SAME convention the real UI itself uses by default (its own default
    "AFFICHER LES RÉSULTATS" filter submission sends an empty array).
    `periodFrame="CUSTOM"` + a real `period.from`/`period.to` (YYYY-MM-DD)
    is used for "this month" (month start -> today); `periodFrame=
    "ALLTIME"` (period=null) is used for lifetime/since-inception totals
    (needed for the XIRR Bonus/Taxes/Intérêts counterfactual shares below)
    - MUCH simpler than Nectaro/Afranga here since these totals are
    already aggregated server-side, no per-transaction classification
    needed for them at all.
  - `POST /gtw/loans/api/balances/v3/all-transactions?page=N&size=500`
    (same body shape as transactions-summary above) -> paginated raw
    transaction list, response shape `{"content": [...], "page": {"size",
    "totalElements", "totalPages", "number"}}`. Each entry:
    `{"amount", "transactionType", "invoiceId", "originatorName",
    "createdOn", "id"}` - `id` is a real, stable, per-row unique string
    (e.g. "FIAT:TAX:<uuid>") - only used here for (a) the since-inception
    DEPOSIT/WITHDRAWAL cashflow list feeding XIRR, and (b) the day-by-day
    cash-wallet reconstruction feeding Cash drag (see
    `_cash_delta_for_transaction()`'s docstring for the verified
    SUBSCRIPTION-vs-INVESTMENT accounting quirk this relies on).
  - `GET /gtw/loans/api/interest-calculator/xirr` -> Debitum's OWN native
    XIRR time series (`{"my": [{"date", "rate"}, ...]}, "top1": [...
    a platform-wide benchmark, unused here]}`) - NOT used for the "XIRR"
    row itself (this repo computes its own since-inception XIRR from real
    DEPOSIT/WITHDRAWAL cashflows + today's total value, exactly like every
    other platform, so the "XIRR Bonus"/"XIRR Cash drag"/etc. counterfactual
    shares can be derived consistently) - kept only as a cross-check
    reference in a future session if the two ever need reconciling.

Since-inception XIRR/Cash drag block (mirrors nectaro_diversification.py's
design exactly - see that module's own docstring for the full
methodology): supports a REPORT_DATE-backfilled past month too - the account
value at that date is the live balances minus every cash/invested movement
after it (see run()).
  - XIRR cashflows: every DEPOSIT (negative, money invested) and
    WITHDRAWAL (positive, money returned) transaction, since account
    inception, fetched incrementally via `debitum_xirr_cashflows_state.json`
    (deduped by Debitum's own transaction "id" field).
  - Terminal cashflow: today's real `investedEur + fiatEur`.
  - Cash drag / XIRR Cash drag / XIRR Bonus / XIRR Taxes/Frais / XIRR
    Intérêts: same counterfactual-XIRR technique as every other platform
    with this block (add the lifetime bonus/taxes/interest total - read
    DIRECTLY from the ALLTIME transactions-summary call, no manual summing
    needed - back to today's total value, recompute XIRR, contribution =
    xirr_real - xirr_counterfactual). Cash drag's own avg-idle-cash input
    is computed via `shared.weighted_average.compute_time_weighted_average()`
    fed by `_cash_delta_for_transaction()` - a day-by-day reconstruction of
    the "non investi" (fiatEur) wallet balance.
  - `_cash_delta_for_transaction()` - IMPORTANT verified accounting quirk:
    Debitum records BOTH a "SUBSCRIPTION" and an "INVESTMENT" transaction
    for the same loan purchase (same amount, different timestamps) - only
    ONE of them is a real cash-wallet movement. Verified live (summed every
    transaction type's own signed `amount` across the account's full
    history): excluding ONLY "INVESTMENT" (treating it as a neutral
    internal reclassification from a pending "subscriptionsAmount" bucket
    into "investedEur") reproduces the live `fiatEur` balance EXACTLY
    (0.9737... EUR, matching to sub-cent precision) - "SUBSCRIPTION" is the
    real debit (the money actually leaves the uninvested wallet when
    SUBSCRIBING, not when the pending subscription later converts into a
    booked investment). Every OTHER observed type's `amount` (TAX,
    AFFILIATE, INTEREST_REPAYMENT, INTEREST_BOOST_REPAYMENT, SUBSCRIPTION,
    DEPOSIT) is ALREADY correctly signed for its cash effect - no
    type-to-sign lookup table needed, unlike most other platforms in this
    repo. A future unrecognized type is NOT specially handled (its
    `amount` is used as-is, since every type observed so far follows this
    same signed-amount convention) - logged for visibility only.

Added 2026-09-09: switched the XIRR Bonus/Cash drag/Taxes/Intérêts shares
from isolated counterfactuals (cancel ONE factor, XIRR_real - XIRR_without
that factor) to a proper Shapley-value decomposition (see
shared/xirr_shapley.py's module docstring) - the old method left an
unexplained gap between XIRR and the sum of its "explaining" shares
because XIRR is non-linear in its cashflows (interaction effects between
factors were silently dropped). Shapley shares are additive by
construction: XIRR Bonus + XIRR Cash drag + XIRR Taxes + XIRR Frais + XIRR
Intérêts now sums back to XIRR real - XIRR with every factor neutralized
(checked at runtime, warns if off by more than 0.0001). Also split the old
single "XIRR Taxes/Frais" share into "XIRR Taxes" (withholding tax, i.e.
`totalTax`) and "XIRR Frais" - Debitum has no platform-fee concept
distinct from withholding tax (transactions-summary only ever exposes
`totalTax`, no separate fee field), so "XIRR Frais" is hardcoded to 0.0,
not computed via Shapley.

Required environment variables:
    DEBITUM_EMAIL, DEBITUM_PASSWORD -> login credentials.
    DEBITUM_TOTP_SECRET             -> base32 TOTP secret (2FA is always
                                       enabled on the observed test
                                       account).
    GOOGLE_SHEET_ID, GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS -> used to write this month's
                                       totals to the Google Sheet, same
                                       convention as every other
                                       *_diversification.py.
